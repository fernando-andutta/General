The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.

I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\n\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.

It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.\n\nIn any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!\n\nWe had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow"}

Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.\n\nMy friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.\n\nThe entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.\n\nIf the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-yxfBYGB6SEqszmxJxd97A"}

After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.

While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!\n\nIt looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!\n\nAs if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.

I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!\n\nTIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online.

I thought to myself, \"how nice\", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.\n\nSo, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a \"different\" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7SO_rX1F6rQEl-5s3wZxgQ"}

Check\nBest thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check\n\nI have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.\n\nIf you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.

I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. \n\nVintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...\n\nThe plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.\n\nThe location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]\n\nThe atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.\n\nCaroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. \n\nThe limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. \n\nThings being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us \"you have to try the Vintage burger\", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.\n\nIn for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.\n\nLike everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.\n\nAt this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.\n\nWe will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FCcFT610nQBVcRdY-devQA"}

The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!\n\nBut the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!\n\nWhen we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.\n\nI was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  \nI ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!\n\nWhen we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.\n\nWhen she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tA2DT7CGQPzgA6tTcTkXDw"}

Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. \n\nI am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.\n\n\nSo as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:\n\n*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.\n\n*Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the \"wings\". This dish is a must try!!\n\n*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.\n\n*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!\n\nLastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.\n\n\nGreen serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving \"meat\" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  \n\nMight I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c1yGkETheht_1vjda7G5sA"}

We couldn't decide on what we wnated so we ended up splitting the entree of Blackened Salmon with Apple/Chipotle chutney and some potatoes. We also got three of the small Plates: mini reuben, crispy calamari and cilantro rubbed grilled shrimp. All the food was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries.

After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.\n\nLuckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  \n\nThat is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.\n\nAs for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). \n\nSo far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.\n\nI did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. \n\nNow for the cliched Yoga Review ending: \n\nNAMASTE!", "type": "review", "business_id": "d7_jkx0VPx3uHsUl18iHMQ"}

They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli.

On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)\n\nIf you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. \n\nFrom their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed. \n\nOh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Y-NqaDy_1bb-Y5dQ33x-Pw"}

We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful.

When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!\n\nWhen you advertise on your website \"showroom quality,\" I expect showroom quality.

WTF buy it and go home and let your kids do kart wheels there. EEWH!\n\nThen, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every 5 minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either. \n\nI was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.\n\nI have been looking for a place to go to read, work and drink some coffee in my area (Arrowhead) and this one is definitely crossed off of my list. \n\nCome here to try and find a book but don't come expecting to kick back and enjoy your novel or what have you. If you like people watching though, this may be your place. There are all kinds here.\n\nPS: and I left my fav coffee mug at this crappy place - like I will go back and get it.

That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.\n\nThey have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.\n\nOverall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "JhupPnWfNlMJivnWB5druA"}

It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. \n\nThe service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of \"everything is good, just order something so I can go home\". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. \n\nIt wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E4b5OC_6mZ0V7B6Nyjncsg"}

A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.\n\nRumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RqbSeoeqXTwts5pfhw7nJg"}

I'd found out about Mrs. White's by way of Lo-Lo's, and thought I'd try Mama's food before Son's.  It was good, I'll say that.  I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading.  Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat.  Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good.\n\nThe ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact \"Jesus\".  LOL.\n\nUnaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars.  Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin.\n\nAs a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable.  Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of \"what are YOU doing here?\" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.\n\nI'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.

Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy. \n\nThe restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. \n\nThe food is best described as \"home cooking\". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland? \n\nOverall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself.

We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass.

Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. \n\nI was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. \n\nThe desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.\n\nThe service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low.

Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. \n\nAbout 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. \nMy grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. \nThere was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right.

As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.

It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.\n\nThe restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)\n\nThe only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a \"Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!\"\n\nOn a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.

Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!\n\nI arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.\n\nThe waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.\n\nI ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.\n\nAmbience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  \n\nJasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!\n\nOn completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.\n\nFor the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1621ir5mjVgbHwxCbMAEjg"}

Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. \n\nThe sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say \"sacrificed or as important\" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). \n\nThe venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, \"don't wear pants,\" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \"cooler\" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? \n\nThe answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. \n\nHate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l3yL2rQ6PoFBQ06RLczn9w"}

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  \nWhen paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.

The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, it's probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.  I consider myself a good cook, but I would leave this up to Richardsons.  As I write this I realize the whole reason for my review is that dish, because I don't remember anything else I had.  Stopped by for drinks the second time, ended up ordering a pizza, expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu, it was really quite good.  Bartender was great (I think he was actually the take-over waiter from my previous visit).  Very cozy place, if you come later or are are willing to wait, you can get a private table in a cave like nook.  The place is not cheap, comparative to other finer dining establishments.  Overall, a lively but romantic place with character, good food, and decent service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "B8ujMtvvpHyEQ2r_QlAT2w"}

But that's because I've been to Joe's Real BBQ, and so I know how good BBQ can be.\n\nFamous Dave's is fine.  There are two of them I know of, and I've been to both.  They're both fine.\n\nWe visited this one, near Chandler mall, for lunch.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  My wife and I both had the brisket sandwich.  I had the Wilbur beans, she had fries.  It was fine.  Not great, but OK.\n\nThe brisket meat itself did not seem to be smoked.  At all.  Meat has a certain look and taste when it has been smoked, and this just didn't have it.  Frankly, the meat seemed sorta pale...as if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked.  And either the meat or the sauce was excessively salty.  It wasn't severe (or I would have returned it), but it was noticeable.  Salt should enhance flavor, not stand out as a major flavor.\n\nAnd a note about the sauce.  I examined one of their 'for sale' bottles (you can buy their sauce to take home).  Did they use molasses or brown sugar, as most self-respecting BBQ chefs would?  No.  High fructose corn syrup.  Yuck.  Besides that stuff being poison to your pancreas, it's just \"not right\".  That's not how BBQ is done.\n\nAnyway, Famous Dave's is really nothing special.  The BBQ is \"OK\", but not very authentic.  Given the choice I would take Joe's, hands-down.  But if you want some BBQ, and are nowhere near Joe's, this will do.  Beats the heck out of Tom's BBQ, that's for sure (see my review of Tom's...truly awful).  And the beans and fries are pretty good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u9MKnG0PqI8N7ixSfrrTiw"}

This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. \n\nI had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.\n\nMy girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. \n\nThe waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. \n\nI would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok.

But that's a good thing. The restaurant would qualify as a \"Dive\" in most circles, a tiny 20 seat affair with recycled refer units as cabinets located in the corner of a strip mall with a 99 cent store and a BigLots. Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.\n\nBut after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.\n\nEvery culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!\n\nA kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.\n\nNow this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.\n\nDon't expect to find the standard \"Mexican Restaurant\" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.\n\nWe had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.\n\nWe also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.\n\nTo finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche that was also a hit.\n\nThe owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.\n\nAs I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.\n\nThey serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.\n\nStop in, you'll be glad you did.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxPPpj5jJKO8DtapF5S-NQ"}

I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!\n\nI went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!\n\nI ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!\n\nWe also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!\n\nFor my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was \"stuffed.\" Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion. \n\nWe definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.\n\nThe atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people \"off\" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.\n\nWe would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out.

Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)\n\nAlso made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed.

Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.\n\nWell, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.\n\nAnd it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.\n\nThey are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! \n\nI am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty \"I don't care\" attitude.\n\nI spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!\n\nThe meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted.

My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the \"questionable meat\" instead of throwing it out!  \n\nI am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff.

I'm sure he'll post up his own review of the place.\n\nThis is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. You also get your glass and go fill 'er up at the fountain yourself. I wasn't sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute I asked \"how big is the salad\" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. That was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a \"size\" with their hands and shrug and say, \"i don't know... about like this?\" So, yeah. I like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a \"mound\" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad. \n\nWhen I ordered \"just water\" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, \"you know what? Just take a regular glass, it's more comfortable....\" He trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and I did only drink water). That was nice, and made me feel like an adult. Not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor's office, when you order water.\n\nI really enjoyed my lunch here - Had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because I'll never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza.\n\nThe caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was \"perfect\" . The portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. The chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes SUCH a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. It was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. And the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. Nice touch. Excellent flavor, every mouthful.\n\nThe cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary.\n\nGranted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, I'm spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonno's in NYC's upper east side. But still, darn good. I'd eat it again. (I took some home and it didn't look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it).\n\nBrett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. I think it had pine nuts too. I got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. Either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. Delicious. \n\nAnd the service was great! The  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals. \n\nGreat food - great service - great vibe.

The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole \"marijuana\" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make. Staff is usually pretty friendly and social though. One last thing is that if you eat there or have to wait for a while your clothes will smell like food :/", "type": "review", "business_id": "HMUvbAHRnbAczNrYy8e5MA"}

Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) \n\nWe ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.\n\nWe both had wine, the \"single glass\" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)\n\nNeither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!\n\nWe also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. \n\nI will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. \n\nThere are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.\n\nGood experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3GAPcBG8SowgrpS6UHlDeQ"}

Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.\n\nThe location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.

Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.\n\nHomemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.\n\nOkonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat\n\nTako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily\n\nThe ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.

When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.\n\nDrinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   \n\nNow the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.\nNo value\n\nFood:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.\nMy mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.\n\nDessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.\n\nValue:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xq9tkiHhyN_aBFswFeGLvA"}

If you're from out of town, this would be a great place to stay since you'll be across the street from a ton of restaurants and bars.\n\nI went to an event here, and haved stayed here a few times.  JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that I've gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need.\n\nThe rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy.  The bathroom was nice as well.   The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views.\n\nThe pool area is where it's at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when you're feeling better.  Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend.   It's not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, it's no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jPhmaY35qGP2qNc68viXPg"}

Here we go.\n\nTHE GOOD: \n* Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. \n* Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere\n* Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.\n\nTHE BAD:\n* Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why.\n* A surly \"aunty type\" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids\n* Said \"aunty type\" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait.\n* Said \"aunty type\" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes.\n* Said \"aunty type\" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh?\n* Said \"aunty type\" doesn't say \"thank you\", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n* Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? \n\nSo, in the end, here's the equation:\n\n1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars.\n\nBah.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RtApx92iFX4n-e1VlQlkmQ"}

It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9Y3aQAVITkEJYe5vLZr13w"}

I work in the industry, live in the industry and have breathed the industry for the last 5 years so I know spas. After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My \"corner\", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.\nBoy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. \nAfter anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.\nAfter being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.\nI chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.\nI definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!\nI plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XTIIAZspxssIF7WenlXmrA"}

So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.\n\nBut in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. \n\nIt has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. \n\nYou are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. \n\nThis is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vJ8h5KUTL5L7taf72zcOlA"}

Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, \"That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.\"\n\n    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, \"I really like the onion naan.\"  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.\n\n    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was \"...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.\"  This has not substantiated, however.\n\n    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was \"Yummy.\"\n\n    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.\n\n    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.\n\n    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; \"...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.

But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \n\n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "V6BYjHM9SnXscfkln3hCdA"}

Oh yeah, and get something to eat. I had remembered some generally good reviews of Drift, had noticed it when going to shows at Martini Ranch, and really wanted something with coconut (?).\n\nAfter a terrifying short-cut with a walking GPS that I was sure was leading us to our death (or at least led us to dog-shit on the sidewalk at one point), we ended up here with a nice enough door guy. Inside I was really impressed. It was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, more sophisticated and while it was Tiki-themed, I thought it was very tongue in cheek COOL interpretation of tiki (very hard to pull off). \n\nWe asked for a booth and got one near the door (which lead to superior people watching later). Our booth was creamy, spacious, left us with no ass swamp, (although the acoustics were a little bad-I had trouble hearing someone two people away) and showed us more intimate tables in very Ikea-esqe and mod black leather. This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there.\n\nOur waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night. \n\nLooking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting. On the way to the bathrooms, a small open lounge was dominated by one party having a lot of fun. The bathroom sink blew my mind and I still don't know what sets it off...although my theory is some dude needs to flush the toilet for water to come down and vice versa. I started freaking out in my drunky state, saying \"I have soapy hands goddamit! And I'm smart! How does this shit turn on!\" wiping my hands on the sink with tiny amounts of water.\n\nOverall, a very chill scene with a bizarre assortment of people (bro dogs, homely couples, musicians, barbies, and just regular folks) perfect for a second or third date for a casually romantic drink or two.", "type": "review", "business_id": "o4DsvwwD2kIbF-EM4r9G8A"}

The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. \n\nExperiences with the order could be as follows: \nGobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. \nLamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. \nChicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. \nDisheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. \n\nFinally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities.

The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.

The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.\n\nThe second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).

The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! \n\nThe chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. \n\nWe just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview.

They're real, and they're spectacular. \n\nOf course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. \n\nAlthough Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.\n\nSpeaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was \"Squaw\" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term \"Squaw\", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as \"Negress\" or \"Jewess\". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.\n\nAnd so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.\n\nNOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vZBYSQtTbY9MaYu5qNuU8Q"}

For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.\n\nMain: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the \"little ear\" pasta and \"alla puttanesca\" means it's made \"whore style\". \n\nAnd what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.\n\nThe pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. \n\nAnd the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.\n\nAs for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, \"oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this.\" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. \n\nSERVICE\n-------------\nVery friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. \n\nAnd the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. \n\nSETTING\n-------------\nI would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. \n\nThe colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. \n\nI definitely don't think this is going to be as \"scene-y\" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. \n\nEXTRA CRIB NOTES\n-----------------------------\n* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.\n* It's great\n* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.\n* it's great\n* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). \n* it's great\n* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.\n* it's great\n* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?\n* did I tell you it's great?\n\nALL IN ALL\n---------------\nAn awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. \n\nI'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.\n\nAnd here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...", "type": "review", "business_id": "r3r_bAfa6pZKIhQB82FizQ"}

He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.\n\nI could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.

However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). \n\nI decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.\n\nThe hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. \n\nSo why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. \n\nThe waiter:\n\n* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.\n* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.\n* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...\"oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano.\" Bonus points for knowing that.\n\nAnyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. \n\nAll in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. \n\nAnd there you have it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ"}

Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.\n\nI have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short: \n\n1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show \"Friends;\" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?\n\n2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, \"yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey.\"  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.\n\n3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.\n\nHonestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fLtUF61A5WrKIRIaWlf9wg"}

The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.\n\nHowever, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.\n\nThen came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? \n\nRegardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read \"SWAG\" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff.

It's actually WCG.\n\n[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed \"Dolphin\" as one of its menu items.

One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well.

We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case. \n\nMy fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.\n\nIt was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ojjtPlnSmCX1zCzWL7JoNQ"}

It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management. \n\nOur first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. \n\nWe decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? \n\nSo that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.

But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying \"seat yourself\". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say.

Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now. \n\n     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.\n\n     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. \n\n     Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  \nBread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!", "type": "review", "business_id": "F8q_9PUl-Lwjj9xIRPArcg"}

I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their \"Burger Daze\", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  \n\nI'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches.

Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.\n\nIn addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with \"entertainment\" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet?

We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. \n\nAfter an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The \"quinoa crust\" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.\n\nWe also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made \"extra spicy\" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ItMihRR-t810HgctGofF3g"}

It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.\n\nI'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...\n\nThe music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.\n\nThe coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.\n\nThere's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.\n\nThere's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.\n\nA lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.\n\nEarly in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. \n\nOrdinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.\n\nThere's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. \n\nI can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.\n\nGrinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there.

Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai.\n\nIf you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vic's is donzo).  I'm a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tai's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hula's could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)!\n\nAs far as the food...its good, but its not Roy's so don't except anything amazing.

If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.

If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.  \n\nPros - \n1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in.\n2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal.\n3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.\n4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!\n5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good. \n6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.  \n7. They always have deals.

We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldn't wait to flee the scene.\n\nLast year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased.\n\nIt probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights.\n\nThe salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but they're cheap and will get the job done.\n\nThis is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Don't get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if it's appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself.\n\nThe portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, don't get the guacamole. It's super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it.\n\nI'm giving this place 3 stars b/c it's a good value if you're sharing, they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing, and the service is very accommodating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CFaRVxsnN4Zjf28cbORKIA"}

I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial \"positive sandwich\"\n\nTop Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.\n\nThe Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. \n\nLettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes\n\nBottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client.

The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. \n\nAnd finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... \n\nPOSITIVE: \n\nFor the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last).", "type": "review", "business_id": "wNUea3IXZWD63bbOQaOH-g"}

Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said \"NO\" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word \"water\") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.\n\nI was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!\" \n\nI said \"It's quite simple.

They discussed all options thoroughly with me and I performed the care that was needed a little at a time -- as it was needed.  This was important to me since many vets that we've visited in the past have handed us an estimate for hundreds or thousands of dollars and wouldn't budge -- insisting that we HAD to do ALL the work listed.

She listened and gave appropriate feedback to my concerns.  This is really the only thing that is preventing a 5 star rating.  Overall they are still the best vet I've visited and I will continue to put my pets lives in their very capable hands.\n\nBTW, we had to have a pet put down because he was ill.

Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I can't imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, I'm more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear it's typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.  I guess if you are craving it that bad like I was, you'll pay the price...", "type": "review", "business_id": "SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ"}

The menu now has a disclaimer saying that some sides may incur an additional charge.  That was two of my gripes on my first visit, so check and check.. \n\nThis time, I ordered an 8pc with 2 large sides...As stated above, chicken was bigger, and it was hot and moist..perfectly seasoned. For sides, I ordered the sweet corn nuggets and mac and cheese. They had run out of mac and cheese and had to make more. It took about 10 minutes to make. Was it worth the wait? It was fresh, REAL macaroni and cheese, baked in the oven, not some \"out of the box\" variety. It was made with real cheese, as witnessed by the stringy cheese when eaten. My comment here is that I prefer a more creamy variety than what it was. But it definitely was better than Kraft mac & cheese in a box. \n\nThe sweet corn nuggets were incredible. Not sure if they are something they make fresh or if it comes out of a freezer bag, but they were delicious little morsels. Nuggets of corn kernals, surrounded by a light crunchy coating and deep fried. \n\nI wanted to try out their fried shrimp, so I got an \"add on\" of 4 fried shrimp ($1.99). At first view, I was disappointed. What I got were 4 very small (think MAYBE 45-50 sized shrimp). They were not even butterflied, which would have made them appear bigger). But upon tasting them, I really enjoyed the flavor. They appeared to be freshly breaded (is it the same seasoned flour used for the chicken?) and were very tasty. My suggestion here would be to 1) butterfly the shrimp and 2) get a slightly larger shrimp (even if it means a price increase).\n \nWith my second trip to LFC, I am becoming an even bigger fan..Tasty chicken, good sides, a clean restaurant, and nice employees.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DnA5Ec7DOvaaCxmnLx2iYw"}

Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says \"yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!\" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.

Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  \n\nTexas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had.

Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( \n\nEntrees.\n\nCajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) \n\nSirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. \n\nSides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.\n\nFried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: \n\nSteak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.

They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.\n\nI ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.\n\nDESSERT\n\nThey have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.\n\nAMBIANCE/SERVICE\n\nThe waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus.

They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.\n\nThere are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.\n\nThere are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8frfhwRITfgjLaDBueU8iA"}

We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was \"Kids Eat Free\" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....\n\nThe pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  \n\nSo for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  \nOh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!\n\nTry the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!\n\nThis is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!

It's extremely basic, no frills, and cheap.  The baklava isn't fabulous, but everything else is worthy of a special trip.  Once again, the chicken shawarma draws me in, though I'll occasionally force myself into breaking out of that far too predictable mold (for falafel since I truly am stuck in a rut).  The hummus is great.  As mentioned, the salads mainly consist of iceburg lettuce, but they are not stingy with the feta and the dressing is amazing.\n\nThere is night, semi-scrubby outdoor seating and the drinks are bottled or canned.  Last year I went with a group of friends for Valentine's Day and there was a musician who was slightly too loud for the environment.  When something special is going on, the owner comes around and checks with the patrons to verify quality and whether or not the activity is enjoyable.  This is always a nice classy touch for a little dive.\n\nIt's a rarer occasion that I find my way down there.  Let's be honest: I only go that direction for SMoCA, the Venue of Scottsdale, and EZ Tattoo.  It's not generally \"my scene\" and it's definitely out of my way.  Any time I find myself doing something in downtown Scottsdale, however, dinner at Pita House prior to the main event is an absolute must.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kfveMaYeaqGVNHPitT4O9w"}

The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.\n\nI don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.

A great way to spend the day when it's hitting over a hundred degrees!  It's about a forty-five minute drive from Phoenix.\n\nI went on a Saturday afternoon, around three or so.  So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.\n\nRentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.\n\nBring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)\n\nAnd yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)\n\nThey require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.\n\nIt's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!  Your ice coolers will be inspected before you're allowed to board!\n\nWe're on the lookout for more rivers to float on!", "type": "review", "business_id": "l3WML3zeuotwUHzhbwCj_w"}

My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. \n\nLet's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. \n\nNow let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. \n\nIf you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw"}

Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.\n\nNote to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!\n\nFortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.

I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist, but I was pleasantly surprised this time.  I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.  I didn't know any of the barbers, so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.  I was treated to a superb haircut, a very satisfying shave, and a facial mask and massage.  My barber, Manuel, was precise, experienced, and he went about his business with style. I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill. Finally, Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut, which makes all the difference for the rest of the day. The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.  Yes, the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service. This is no Supercuts or Hair Salon--trust me on that.  If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head, please give Vs a try.

I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesn't have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess it's supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French.\n\nSo the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.\n\nThat was when they pulled out dessert.\n\nI'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.\n\nI have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.\n\nBefore I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.\n\nWhile it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.

The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.\n\nWhen you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. \n\nI often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. \n\nTo say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.\n\nI love this place and hope I always will.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8o-NLKy_XfbJtqljX9XLCA"}

The sandwich was well balanced and moist. It was served with iceberg, roma tomatoes and a side of their house fries, \"Kilo Fries.\" The fries were seasoned with a cheese blend, which seemed a little dry to me. However, a quick swirl in olive oil improved them quite a bit. The tea was delicate and refreshing - a nice complement to my lunch selection.\n\nThe service is what stood out for me here. My server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal, even though I was dining solo. I certainly felt that my business was valued here.

The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, \"well we don't have anymore of that one.\"\n\nThanks.

Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants.

Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. \n\nKid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. \n\nBread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.\n\nNow I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. \n\nDecor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.\n\nKid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it.

The franchise contracts out to a provisioner to make all their cold cuts under the Jersey Mike's label, but the meat does not have the flavor of New Jersey's finest deli meats, Thumann's. Boar's Head doesn't come in close to Thumann's but I'll take Boar's Head when nothing else is available. Third place goes to Dietz and Watson.  If Peter Cancro, the CEO of Mike's really cares, he'll get his meat elsewhere. \n\nThe staff was very friendly, the restaurant was clean, there were blown up photos of the Pt.

You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)\n\nOur first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!\n\nFor entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said \"we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it\"....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!\n\nOur second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.\n\nOverall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VGhMTZyqmGmM4Lrn9i6yuQ"}

We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.\n\nI made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.\n\nThe place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.\n\nOur waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.\n\nThe Food:\n\n* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.\n* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.\n* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good\n* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.\n* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.\n* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.\n\nAll-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8m08a9xJKmANwmeuR-0bPA"}

A long-time cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer!  \n\nAs far as the course itself, this is not typical AZ golf - there are no cacti, only tree-lined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats.    But there are birdies to be had, and lots of them; #1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15 and 18 are the best chances in my experience (I consider this my home course).  The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow - this is grainy bermuda, not some hybrid or bent grass, so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole.  #5 is my favorite hole, a short-par 5 that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway, leaving you a long to mid-iron into an elevated green that slopes toward you.  #8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block (or slice, as may be the case) the ball from time-to-time, as your ball will face a watery grave.  #16 is a tricky tree-lined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right.  And finally, #18, a short par 5 that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey.  A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees (but rarely plays it's full length), there are some low scores out there.\n\nA great course, value, practice area, and recently renovated restaurant and bar - 5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bRk44ShCT0osos-1xaTRyA"}

After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.\n\nIn short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and it's on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if you're lucky, you'll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.\n\nThe good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars.

We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. \n\nThe music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. \n\nThe crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!\n\nThe atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a \"sports cafe\"?? \n\nThe service: OMG, we had one beer each and the \"line\" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.

I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)\n\nthe bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.\n\nbut car's running great!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Kau5iJl6VR-TJ20YGrL7MQ"}

The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.\n\nWe made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). \n\nSince my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, \"I can't imagine it will be much longer.\" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.\n\nWhere was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?\n\nWe left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.", "type": "review", "business_id": "W7xb2iS4cYL14Yi5LOGSkA"}

Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.\n\nThe Service\nMy visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.\n\nThe Food\nWe started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And \"Jumbo\" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.\nFor the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.\nSurprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.\nAfter dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  \n\nAtmosphere\nWe were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WSHQ9qpL39g5xA3E5iBCmw"}

There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall it's a pretty easy course.\n\nSome of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.  \n\nMost of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There aren't any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.

During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.  \n\nDaytime:\nThe pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the \"worst and trashiest\". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.\n\nNighttime:\nMuch improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W.

I am not a fan of waking up at 4am in the morning to get there by 5am...not for fishing.  Yes, that is all my boys do here. It gets really packed on the weekends by 9am.   When the water is low, it is not easily accesible from the picnic spots.  It also gets super windy, enough to go windsurfing (too bad it's a long treck for us).   You really have to have a boat to enjoy this lake.  The absence of shade trees make the heat uncomfortable in the middle of summer, you might as well go to Canyon or Saguaro (my faves).\n\nI love the sharp edged cliffs juxtaposed against the crystal clear water.  Good photo ops.\n\nWhy the 4 stars?  Like I said, my hubby loves fishing here for the bass.  For some reason, little bluegills like me.  I also like the floating porta-john and porta-jane...weird, but cool!  Whoever does the draining has a crappy job.\n\nAll in all, it is a nice big lake and by far one of the cleanest too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sv8tYgFzIRKHHERURumyVQ"}

I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.\n\nThis is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita.\nThere are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices.\nI ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.\n\nNeed spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else.\nThe best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a \"specialty store\" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.\n\nOn to the \"restaurant\" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.\n\nOkay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj.\nI'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad.\nGyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine.\nChicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too.\nI'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when\n.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6oRAC4uyJCsJl1X0WZpVSA"}

Trying to be a good sport I went with it. \n\nNext came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, \"Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,\". In other words, no straight answers. \n\nWe sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. \"If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms.\" \"If you choose option B, then only here\" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. \"Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!\"   From there he was down right rude.\n\nI walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street.

We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!\n\nWhen you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!\n\nWe were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.\n\n****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!\n\nIn speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.

We ordered pasta entree's and chicken, all of which were served up warm and in plentiful portions.  We left with a fair amount of food.  I would give the food four stars.  However, I would give the service one star.  Two in our party ordered cocktails.  Five of us ordered wine with dinner.  All drinks arrived together with our entrees.  We did not get enough dinner plates.  We did not get enough wine glasses, and had to wait for three more.  Three entrees arrived together, and we had to wait about five minutes for the fourth to arrive.  We had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in.  We were never asked if we wanted dessert.  If the service were spot on, the rating would be much higher, but, I can't justify it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1oFvqm7eSpJbVpxpPxueaA"}

If there are ingredients or flavors that you don't much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get.  \n\nIt can be daunting, because you may get something that you don't like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!)  You also may get something that you've never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan.  \n\nAlso, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill.\n\nFor the best experience, don't go when you are famished, and don't bring picky eaters with you - both will interfere with you having a completely satisfying experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_AvHni-xdRHmZ3XfYHwGkg"}

The experience comes so close to 5-star that it makes me want to nit-pick about all the tiny things that fall juuuust short so they can fix them for my next visit!\n\nThe Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth?\n\nThe Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partner's Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce would've saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor.\n***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own!\n\nThe Atmosphere:  It's a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasn't sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor.\n\nThe Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).  \n\nA note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that would've won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos I've ever had! :)\n\nLots of wonderful food still to try here.

We went specifically for the fact that their happy hour lasts until 7pm, and they have a great patio.  We have always received attentive service, and when sitting at the sushi bar, you receive complimentary edamame and miso soup (although their version is kind of salty and not my favorite).

Here's what went wrong:\n\nThe event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.\n\nWe walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.\n\n20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.\n\nIt's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...\n\nBy now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own \"Wine Down Wednesday\" at home.\n\nI bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of \"if I could give them less than 1 star I would\" comes in...\n\nOh yeah, and I slapped down a \"You've been Yelped\" card as I left.\n\nTake that Tastings!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "NleiJA9dpfKjhxe0cCD1MA"}

The portions of the appetizers they are now serving to their patrons is just sad. The brie app I so love at this place was enough for two bites per person,which i assume they thought was ok because they cut up like two apples for us. If i were interested in cut up apple for an app i would have stayed home and eaten one, not gone to a restaurant and payed $10.00. The rest of the meal was just mediocre  to say the least, for a restaurant that only serves sandwiches you would think they would be absolutely incredible. The service that night was pathetic the staff there seemed less than eager to be working for Orange table.

My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). \n\nWe went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). \n\nLines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. \n\nWe went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FkHhy6kWeoJf0xJTqzRWmg"}

(Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)\n\n1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A \"2\" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!\n\nPeeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...\n\nSmells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.\n\n#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar\n\nCulinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. \n\nNinja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.\n\n\n# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal\n\nCulinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even \"fenced in\" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.\n\nNinja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.\n\n\n# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami\n\nCulinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.\n\nNinja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  \n\n\nCoconut Ice Cream: Yum\n\nCulinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.\n\nNinja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.\n\nI will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.  \n\nOverall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV\n\nDo you hear the sound of a bell chiming?", "type": "review", "business_id": "hwXFp8FKJ7ivQb8_f4X23g"}

The boyfriend agreed it lacked flavor and was 'off'. \n\nThen yesterday we decided to have another one of these nights, and do the Pizza instead since our pizza was good the first round. I got chicken and pepperoni on mine, and he got sausage. They charge extra for chicken. Um.. I don't really understand why.

A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.  \n\nSince I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says \"Lunch Specials\" and where it says \"Sandwiches.\"  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?  \n\nInstead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.  \n\nMy husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.  \n\nAll in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.  \n\nMy husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDs4eWoV-cpJystzTAH0qg"}

Poor choice! Not a bad place to eat, but a terrible dining experience. \n\nParking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!\n\nI dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice. \n\nThe soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered. \n\nMy bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff. \n\nI had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved. \n\nDessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong. \n\nThe ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours. \n\nI suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.\n\nThe check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either. \n\nTo his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that \"the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished\". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.\n\nThis place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered. \n\nSorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zG_wv69bsllw_PWhOmoAKQ"}

I love the idea of playing old b-movies and some forgotten favorites. The boyfriend and I went to MADCAP last weekend to see their Chuck Jones presentation. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed, not that it was completely MADCAP's fault but still.\n\nMy biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.\n\nIf they showed new independent movies for $10 and old movies for $5 I think they would really have something cool going on.

I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table.

The bacon was the saving grace, as the burger itself was a little dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. You can also have different styles of \"loaded\" fries, I had seasoned fries with cheese and bacon. When I think about my meal there, it's amazing that I've lived long enough to write this review...\n\nIt's a quaint little place, you can either walk up and eat outside or do the drive thru, either way the food is ready pretty quick. In addition to burgers they have chicken strips and a double decker fish sandwich, so it's not all about the red meat.

It was basically kind of like bacon stir-fried with fresh vegetables with a spicy Hunan black bean sauce. I love bacon and I really liked this dish. My wife had prawns w/vegetables, we liked the freshness of the vegetables and generous amount of prawns but overall the dish was slightly bland. She liked it but thought that it would have been better with the lobster sauce. We were mixed on the iced tea, my wife felt it was too strong but I thought it was fine. \n\nOverall, Mr Chao's is a fine choice in Ahwatukee for Americanized Chinese food.

Luckily I was able to call them and talk to people who straightened everything out, but I really get a strong feeling that they're a very small company that's still trying to learn the ropes.\n\nThe biggest problem I had was that my shipping and billing addresses are different. There's a box where you type in your shipping address, then it takes you to the billing section. When I got my order confirmation, I noticed that my billing address and shipping address were listed as the same at the top of the order, then lower down in the order section was where I had typed in my correct shipping address, yet it was partially cut off. I called them about it and they assured me that it was shipping to the correct address, however once I called UPS and had them reassure me that my cards were coming to the correct address, I received another email from Taste saying that the reason my samples weren't delivered was because I didn't give them the correct address. I looked back at my confirmation receipt and the correct address was typed into the bottom of my order. It was a matter of not paying attention I guess.\n\nSuggestions would be to either pay closer attention to their customers entire order, or to work on the billing/shipping page instead of leaving it as a box to type words in, especially if it's not going to be read.\n\nPros are that they get back to you very quickly and make sure that your custom order is correct for print.\nCons seem to be the shipping and customer care portion.\n\nWill I order from them again?

I get winter special of Ishikari - Salmon, cabbage, tofu and rice noodles rather cleverly cooked in a miso based soup in industrial type mini-bucket with oak sealing lid and apparently brought to table from oven. The salmon infusion into the miso was an incredibly delightful broth. The salmon appeared to be generous, good quality but a bit undercooked and I didn't have the time window to do anything about it. The rest...the tofu / cabbage / etc. seemed to derive no benefit from the delightful miso broth.\n\nSo in the end...I probably could have given them 4 stars because there is nothing inherently wrong with CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe.

The assortment of beverages is outstanding, offering both Coke and Pepsi products, juices, CapriSun, horchata, beer, and Sunny Delight!  The menu is about par for Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, in terms of content and price.  I got a fish taco, which was outstanding!  No cheap tartar sauce here!  I also got a cheese quesadilla, which came garnished with lettuce and tomato slices.  The quesadilla was warm and fresh, on an obviously fresh tortilla filled with tasty cheese.  For the two of us to eat a few a la carte items from the menu, the total came to $11.00.  There are also combination plates available, as well as quite a few soups.  Overall, I was very impressed!

Not the concept of a good vegetarian restaurant but the need to create mock this and mock that. The word mock appears on the menu no less than 30 times, and that made me want to flee pell mell at mach 1 out of there, sonic boom be damned. I understand it from a  marketing strategy to appeal to and or convert the carnivores and omnivores I suppose. Do meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it is shaped like a chicken wing? Has anyone gone to a steak joint and had mock carrots made from pork medallions?  I am also aware that we eat with our eyes, have preconceived notions of certain types of cuisine etc. However, I firmly believe that if an establishment uses veggies, legumes, tofu and such and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the meat wheel, the end result would be much better. For Example the Mexicali burger, no mock meat reference here. How about listing something as \"whatever the hell it is\" served Parmesan style? \n \nI stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was in the area. Cool space, it was open colorful and inviting. A couple of organs line a small space up front. Nice mild funk flavor to the decor. Ordering is done counter style and they bring it out to you. You pretty much go behind the counter to get ice for your beverage which I thought was a bit of a weird queue. \n\nI ordered the spicy Thai peanut, a dish that offered mock choices, but I went with the crispy tofu. The brown rice that was the bedding here was ok, lukewarm at best. the dish lacked any real flavor and there was no spice whatsoever.The tofu tasted as if it was freezer burned, which really dumbfounded me. I think it may have been crisped long before it was served to me and microwaved, the texture was just off. Copious amounts of cock sauce, err... Sriracha saved it from blandsville.\n\nI am not saying I would never return, as I tend to give places more than one chance. I love well prepared vegetarian dishes, just don't mock me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c1yGkETheht_1vjda7G5sA"}

At first glance, it appears to be identical, but on closer look it wins in two important categories.  First, the vast menu blows away the Paradise selection of \"like 3 items\"  There are countless sandwhiches, salads, soups and deserts.  Second of all, the prices are incredible.  It is very affordable for the quality and quantity of food.  Finally, the food is excellent.

So, will try to capture the original intensity of the yelp.  I still love my blackberry and maintain it is better than iPhone, by the way!\n\nAnyway, anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life.  When I moved to Phoenix to work for a catholic hospital, my best friend bought me a \"Jesus toast\" stamp which puts an imprint of the Mary which appears better when the bread is toasted.  I guess she wanted me to fit in.\n\nSo when I told my waiter I was having a \"bad toast experience\" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, \"this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the \"toast\" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, \"this is the toast that comes with your meal\".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?\n\nOk, now all the anger is stirred up... I must say that My florist is one of my fav weeknight spots and their pianist is first rate-amazing.  She truly plays from her soul and her personality shines through in her interpretations of classic songs.

Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.\nTurns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.\nThe burger patties are different... they're about 1/8\" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the \"value basket\" deal.\nTheir frozen yogurt or \"concrete mix\" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their \"brownie cookie dough\".

Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say \"Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?\" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. \n\nThe spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. \n\nBefore I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. \n\nThai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ujLZmyy11g1JHCQTxRA3Dw"}

The food was great, but the service was downright abysmal.\n\nIn a fit of random adventurousness, I thought it would be fun to try a new kind of food for me.  I'm typically a weenie and afraid of anything \"weird\" so this is a big deal for me.  We drove out here on Friday night and at around 6 or so the restaurant was about half full.  We stood at the door for entirely too long while we waited to be seated.  When we were at our table, we waited entirely too long to get menus.  When we knew what we wanted, we waited entirely too long to place our order.  You get the idea.  Thankfully the food came out fairly quickly.  \n\nI ordered the vegetarian plate that had collard greens, some kind of cabbage/carrot/potato thing, red lentils, and some bean/carrot/onion thing.  As with all dishes, it was served with the injera, a weird sourdough crepe thing.  I was a little weirded out that the bread thing was served cold, but I got used to it quickly enough.  Everything on my plate was yummy, but if I were to rank it, my favorite would be the lentils, followed by the collard greens, then the potato, then the carrot/bean thing.  \n\nEating here was a fun experience for sure, and not having any silverware definitely made for some creative feeding procedures.  I would probably come back here if the mood for Ethiopian food struck me again, but I would really hope that the service would be better.  Since everyone else mentions great service, I am going to assume we came at an \"off\" time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-bd26a1QEEpqUZjBmtBUiQ"}

I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.\n\nWhen my salmon dish came out I said to my self \"WHAT in the hell?\" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.\n\nNext, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again \"What in the HELL?\"  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.\n\nThe meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.

Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era, eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat, and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives, all while having a merry time.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.  Once you pass through the gates, you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.  Men, women, and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing, shopping, and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment, jousting tournaments, over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares, and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing, leatherworking, weaving, woodcarving, blacksmithing, candlemaking and pottery.\n\nOne specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.  Here, a family of three (father, mother, and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.  \n\nThe store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.  The categories range from mythological symbols, to astrological, to even ancient Egyptian.  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin, they place a blank, either bronze or silver, between each dye and clamp it to a press.  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye, eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.  \n\nWhat's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.  Additionally, what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away, making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.  \n\nIf you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon, which I would undoubtedly recommend, be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pgz6IeaZgLuzqrk6HMPhzA"}

Get the Hawaiian toppings, and both the polish sausage and bratwurst are good, I don't think I've had a regular beef dog.\n\nThis is one of the two places with good dogs I frequent that are like a block away from me. I go here if I want something unique, they go for a mix of sweet and spice here, and it works. I recommend the sweet and spicy dog, the sunset dog, and the spam sliders Maui style. Whatever I get I usually make it a meal with tots and either red cream soda or green tea.\n\nOn my visit today they were giving away free samples of chicken wings with every meal. I liked the crispness of the skin, and once again the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and spicy. If (when) I order them in the future I'm going to ask for extra sauce though. The only thing I've had here that I wouldn't get again is a burger with chili on it. The thin chili is fine on a dog you're going to eat with a fork, not as much in a burger. Thankfully the cook was nice enough to suggest that I should get the chili on the side if I was ordering to go, so I still got home with decent food and not a soggy mess.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t4aP7ksa716XY6S4EsWFqw"}

Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. It's pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors. \nI had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. That's still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So I'm disappointed with the festival offerings. \n\nParking covered & uncovered was $10 if you could not find free street parking. There wasn't enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety. \n\nThe entertainment was very limited. I hope they will seek more entertainment in the future especially since they claim its one of the top 20 street festivals in the country.

Another appetizer was a date wrapped in bacon - this was super delicious and easy to eat. I ordered a pineapple mojito and at first our server was confused, saying they don't have a blender but could make us a raspberry mojito. (I've had bartenders tell me they don't have blenders when I've ordered mojitos before, so I was used to this.) Luckily, our server came back later telling me she was confused and viola a delicious pineapple mojito was placed in my hands with a large slice of pineapple on the rim. It was amazing! So good, the husband had to order one for himself. Our party moved inside to a private room where we were given tiny menus with simple selections. The husband ordered the beef entree, steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and I ordered the scallops with corn polenta. While the scallops were delicious, the steak was super tender and moist! (Better than a fillet we had the night before!) For desert, I ordered the chocolate cake with coffee crema inside and the husband ordered the cheesecake.

So when I came to Phoenix for work, I wanted to see what the Filipino restaurant scene was like.\n\nLike the previous reviewer stated, there are very few Filipino eateries. The supermarket that I found on my GPS was closed, so I found this one on Yelp. Overall, I would recommend to go to support the local Filipino restaurant.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you start in the bake shop area where you'll find cakes and pastries on display. I wasn't sure if I could seat myself, but I was greeted and seated. There were two other tables filled with about 8 people eating including myself. What concerned me is that 2 of the other folks were the only other Filipinos - as I tend to judge all ethnic restaurants by the number of people of the same ethnicity.\n\nBut that logic doesn't seem to work here were the demographics of Filipinos seems relatively low.\n\nI was craving Sisig (grilled pork - which is my favorite at Ongpin in South San Francisco) - but they didn't have that. On the whiteboard, they had Sinigang na Baboy (pork) - so I figured I couldn't go wrong with one of my favorites.\n\nSince I was here on business, I figured I'll order a few other things including the shanghai lumpia (eggrolls), Halo Halo, and topped it off with Hot Pandesal.\n\nThe Sinigang was served in a bowl with 3 pieces of boneless pork. The meat was very tender and you can pull it apart with a spoon and fork. The soup was a little on the salty side since they may have put a little more tamarind mix, but that I might just be a little oversensitive about my sodium intake.\n\nI couldn't help but think that I was eating at home or a family friend's house. Included in the sinigang was spinach, string beans, eggplant, a small potato, and cut onions. What was missing was dikons (those white radish things). It wasn't bad, and it wasn't exceptionally delicious because nothing compares to home made sinigang. But this would be the next best thing. I ate all the meat, and had quite a few eggplants left.\n\nThe shanghai lumpia came out shortly afterwards. The portion was pretty large and I could have shared it with someone else. I didn't care for sauce that it came with. I wanted vinigar, but a filipino family came in and there was only one server.\n\nIf you ever had Halo Halo at Ongpin, you'd find this lacking. It is served it a large plastic cup. What was missing is the ube ice cream. In fact, there was hardly any ube in it. There was a spoonfull of the leche flan, but I didn't finish it.\n\nI actually ordered the Pandesal later, this version was like two very large dinner rolls served with butter. The bread had a fresh out of the oven taste.\n\nThe restaurant section was clean, with standard fare dining. There was a large flatscreen tv with TFC playing.\n\nLast week, when I ate there, they were just written about in the local paper, but I didn't get to read the review.\n\nThey accept Master Card and Visa, but not American express.\n\nI would eat here again to try some of their other dishes not because I want to support my fellow Filipinos, but because the food is actually worth having again. I took some photos of each dish with my iPhone, so I'll have to figure out how to upload them.\n\nThis is actually my first review because I was hoping to read more about Philippine restaurants in the area, I only saw this one. So I figured, I should also contribute!", "type": "review", "business_id": "iJPG0GPcIirjOMlmzZWxBQ"}

Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.\n\nMy wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.\n\nShe also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.\n\nOh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.  \n\nThis is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.\n\nAnd for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.\n\nI believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.\n\nDuring our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.\n\nThese tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.\n\nAlthough Roberto's delivers, I regret that they won't come to Dana Point.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uPDTnuR-sOi47blHH943lg"}

It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport.\n\nTerminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.\n.  \nTo go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.\n\nThe other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.\n\nGet going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g"}

This place is just bad.\n\nMixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on \"special.\"\n\nThe food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from \"freezer to fryer\" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.\n\nOne of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons \"how is everything?\" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.\n\nIn this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen.

It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. \n\nThe room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.\n\nFYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.\n\nMy main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.\n\nI guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities.

We ordered a variety of menu items (and in typical 'When Harry Met Sally...' style) - a grilled chicken spinach and goat cheese sandwich (subbing the goat cheese for American & changing the multigrain bun to egg), a build-your-own burger with an egg bun, spicy chipotle mayo, pickles and onions, an order of Smashfries, an order of french fries and an order of fried pickles.  Everything was made perfectly to order and plenty of extra sauces (ranch, etc;) were provided without having to ask.  \nOn weekends, this shop is jam packed and it's a wait to get a table, but worth it.  During the week, everything flows very smoothly and the vultures \"circling\" for booths is at a minimum.  \nI highly recommend this Smashburger location whether dining in or taking taking your meal on the go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KT_r7qwU8sSfcR31zETGkg"}

A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department. \n\nWhen I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new \"parents\" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home. \n\nTo make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense. \n\nWhile I visited the Humane Society, I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit? \n\nThis Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA"}

We've been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, \"fresh jalapenos!\") and the great selection of sodas.\n\nThe peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.\n\nI personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.\n\nSince the Zagat announcement earlier this week, it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table.\n\nFive Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.\n\n3 tips:\n\n-Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.\n\n-Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker \"Little Cheeseburger\" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the \"Little\" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings.\n\n-Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and \"POOF!\", you'll get it!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nUPDATE: Gotta drop 'em to 4 stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.

The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.  Also, my meal only ran me about $8.50 and it was very filling and worth every penny.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bQ1s5pqX_UVWVQ-k4e9rAg"}

Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. \nNow I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. \n\nOnly other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger.

Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.  \n\nWe ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please.\n\nJust based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "b5cEoKR8iQliq-yT2_O0LQ"}

Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.\n\nSecond of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.\n\nI ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  \n\nAnd lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.

The tomatoes were crisp and fresh, the chopped garlic was very complimentary, and the oil had a fantastic flavor.  Definitely a good choice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.

We both left with a full belly and intentions to return again soon.\n\nI have no complaints about the food (delicious!), but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons:\n\n1. The lights are way too bright.  While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints I've been to, a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere!\n\n2.  One of my favorite treats at Italian restaurants is bread dipped in tasty olive oil with fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.

I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. \n\nWe parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. \"Onward!\" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. \n\nA little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us \"lost,\" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. \"Let's ask somebody,\" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, \"Will this trail loop back around?\" \"Where do you want to go?\" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. \n\nWe pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.\n\nWe set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. \n\nHaving hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. \"Let's hitch a ride,\" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. \n\nThat's when a car slowed down. \"Ugh, creep,\" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, \"We can take him.\" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. \n\nWe chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. \n\nThe kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. \n\nWe counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PoRYjYUSjmeWM1WLsx_45w"}

Coffee makes me have to pee and when I discovered this and had to walk all the way to the baby gap because the place next door with a bathroom wasn't open yet requiring me to pack up my computer and leave my drink and food unattended, it was a bit undesirable. I know it's a mall type area but it still surprised me for a drink/food place. It does not set the tone for a place to spend a lot of time which may be their intention. Also, I love John Mayer but they played his same songs over and over again.

Let me first start with the location.  It's very stupid.  Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don't need \"personality\" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can't subtract stars for this, it doesn't make sense.\n\nAs for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn't.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.\n\nThe peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it's texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.\n\nSprinkles, I will not be back.  I don't like you.  Good luck in all you do though.

That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this.

Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides. \n\nAs I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up. \n\nThe atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.\n\nHere's my old review for reference: \n\nGreat margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.\n\nIt's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  Salsa sucks.\n\nIt's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier.

If you are doing a mobile Yelp for this place, it is most defiantly open.\n\nSecond, I decided to give them a try for an early Friday dinner, about 5 in the evening. There were a few people dining in the restaurant, and quite a few people on staff for the evening. The dining room is pretty well decorated, more so than I thought it would be, giving a faux Hawaiian feel to it. Seeing some people there at that time gave me hope for a good meal.\n\nI asked the lady manning the counter what was good, and she took a bit of time to walk me through the menu. Emphasizing the plate lunches, I decided to try the Combo that would get me the most variety. I elected for terriyaki beef and kalua pork. I took the side of the 'potato mac' and got my meal to go.\n\nArriving home, my meal sat for about 5 minutes before I had it unboxed and ready to enjoy. Considering that fact, everything was in pretty good condition. The potato mac was a bit more room temperature than cold, but that was my own doing. The rice stayed warm, the pork moist and really flavorful, and the beef sweet and tender.\n\nHaving dined at a few places offering plate lunches in the past, the potato mac was probably what sold me as much as the meats on why I'll return. Potato mac's tend to have a pretty flat flavor, and when I find out how Hawaiian's garnish them, I will be excited to get some more flavor in them. But it was just the right amount of dry ... I've had many potato mac's that are just too wet, but this felt about perfect.\n\nI'll give the fish dishes a try in the future and report on those.

The egg drop soup wasn't too good though. Spare ribs weren't bad. Also a little dry, but not as bad as the chicken. The Egg-foo-yung was not good. Hockey puck shaped or not, it was too watery and didn't taste like real Egg-foo-yung. Everything else was pretty average. For the price, it wasn't bad. I would go back and eat there just so I could have the rice and shrimp. So pretty much 2 stars for the food and 1 for the atmosphere, service and cleanliness. Place was very clean and service was decent. Not a 4 star restaurant. Barely a 3 star. I think my wife gave it 2 stars. If you go there and find certain foods you like, it's probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods. Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods. Other buffets will run you $10-$15, so this place could be a gem if the food gets better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HEI4WFai9zoixD5GhCnbeg"}

Beer of the month (always fun to try), 20% off beer or wine to-go (what is this, Vegas?), happy hour specials (you had me at \"daily\"), the list goes on and on.\n\nGood food, great energy, small, cozy inside and an nice patio space too.

One girl took our drink order, another brought them, someone else took our food order, someone else brought our food, and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers, not to mention the kitchen staff. \nSo the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means, just slow and a little unattentive. \nIt seemed to turn into a club style late at night, which could explain the extensive staff. \nThere is a wheel that you can spin with different actions on it, such as, \"kiss a random' '50% off bill\" \"go plastic\" (which apparently gives you a chance to win plastic surgery). I would suggest NOT attempting this if you are not single. \nOverall, the food was GREAT!!!! The place was clean (bathrooms could use attention). The service could use some tweeking.

As far as the food. That is one star. \nWhile having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried \"Tradiciones\" I would give them a try. \nI enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. \nThe salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. \nI was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. \n\nThe platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a \"mole\". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! \n\nThe only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. \n\nWhile I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vA8T8QXh78iSXhxShLNgQA"}

So when I had out of town company visiting, we made a trip to the Olive Mill and signed up for the tour. \n\nThe tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth.\n\nWhile waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday. \n\nAfter the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didn't stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful. \n\nThe only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). It's actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so that's all you could really taste. \n\nThe ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones. Perhaps a few more hours in the oven, and they would have been better - but I don't recommend going out of your way to check this place out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7YYD_agS3Kb2sAx9JPkQEw"}

Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!  \n\n$10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.  \n\nIt was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!  \n\nWill I be back next year?

The Thai Peanut Sauce Pizza was a little weird, yet still tasty in its own way, and I could only handle one slice before growing tired of peanut sauce.  The Buffalo Chicken Wing Pizza was also pretty good. The highlight of the menu was the beer. The Elsie's Irish Cream, a milk stout, was one of the best stouts I've had (better than the Left Hand Stout). It had a strong coffee flavor but in a good way (I don't drink coffee). The Orange Blossom (mandarin orange hefeweizen) was the best Hefeweizen I've ever had, and I generally don't like Hefeweizens. The orange flavor definitely made that drink more than tolerable. I tried several other beers from Papago's own brewery, and the rest seemed  good. They have dozens of bottled beers in the fridges along the walls. But I never got a chance to try any of them. \n\nPRICE: Around $5 per beer on tap. Personal pizzas were $9 and large pizzas that could feed 2-3 people were $18. Appetizers were around $5. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Pretty neat place. Funny statues, tvs, darts and all wooden furniture. Drawbacks are very small tables, uncomfortable chairs, odd layout, and almost too loud at times. \n\nSERVICE: The place seemed a little understaffed at times. We would be helped my a couple employees throughout the night as one would have to run behind the bar to make drinks or clean. All the servers were very nice and patient, but seemed to be a little overwhelmed and, thus, forgot to bring me a drink I ordered. \n\nSKINNY: Papago Brewing Company Inc has its pros and cons, but overall its a good place. I would definitely go there for the beer, while the pizza is good but nothing to rant about. Some may disagree with me, but I still prefer Tempe's own Four Peaks. I feel Four Peaks' food is better, better seating, and the beers are just as good as Papago's flavors. Don't let this comparison discourage you! Papago's is still a good place to drink and eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "luCSjoNQ9q_0QIjKKOy2pQ"}

Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. \"I'm a wishful thinker\"\n\nSeveral more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by \"place was trashed\" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said\", oh sorry forgot\" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.\n\n\nThen the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..\n\nShort list\n\n-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.\n\nBut it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..\n\nAnother one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.\n\nWhere I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. \n\nAt this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. \n\nHe took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. \n\n\n\nIn short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. \n\nI do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.\n\n\nI will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.\n\n\n-Thanks for reading this little novel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hebts_NucpamjCG2B9VY5g"}

But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. \n\nWe went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a \"valet\" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. \n\nSadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. \n\nWe ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). \n\nFor dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. \n\nAnd honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). \n\nAnd hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5.

He checked my eyes, did all of the tests and I walked out with my prescription.\n\nHere is why I can't give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think he's wonderful...)\n\n1)  I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9.  My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m.  This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me.  I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again.  I also learned all about his wife, friend's boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited).\n\n2)  I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses.\n\n3)  The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much.  I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- \"buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that you'll instantly go blind\"; however, if I want something, I'll ask for it...just like any other retailer.  \n\nLike I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription.  However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctor's cheesy personality and the \"hard-sell\" environment.  Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them.  \n\nHence, why I do most of my shopping online.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tHP-YGYtc5-t3MofXFgk2A"}

Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. \n\nOk, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate:\n\n - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo.\n\n - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. \n\nAll in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it. \n\nCombined with the fact that we were sitting awkwardly on the patio, which was really just sort of jutting out into the mall, I can't justify more than 3 stars. However, would I try it again? Absolutley. Get the steak? Maybe not. But I think that, for a relatively new restaurant, they're well on their way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YCCDMLcb7UW8G-o_HsWiiA"}

The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).  \n\nGenerally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well. \n\nService was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed.\n\nI haven't indulged in a lot of the desserts, but I am a fan of the Italian creme cake.  It's moist, and not too sweet.  \n\nPrices are moderate, and entrees will be around 15 dollars, give or take a few dollars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E4KKFmUsWzgv-pPISdi1BQ"}

It sure looks like it.) The last leg is bascially boulders that you have to crawl over, but the view at the top is an unbeatable 360-degree view of the Valley. Though South Mountain has a more centralized view, on Camelback you really feel on top of the whole Valley.\n\nMy only complaints: First, the parking is a nightmare, especially on the weekends.

I can normally dismiss such things, but it became evident that our bad service was not a fluke.\n\nWe arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldn't be a problem at all except that our waitress didn't return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons, but it certainly wasn't so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately, on each of our visits, the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused\n\nThe food itself was quite good. The Shepherd's pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about, but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced. \n\nConsiderably later in the evening, our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying she'd remove it, but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of \"$20 on the credit card. The rest in cash\" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, that's all.\n\nWhen she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. That's just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself. \n\nWe spoke to the manager, who couldn't find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink.\n\nIt wasn't worth arguing about at that point.\n\nThe sad part is that everyone at my table, and our surrounding tables started telling similar tales from past visits.

My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.\n\nThe first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. \n\nOne of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.\n\nThe chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.\n\nI ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. \n\nI know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.\n\nSo, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. \n\nWhat I paid for this was ridiculous.\nThe way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.\nThe food was meh.\nNot even I was tempted to try breakfast there.\nIt was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.\n\nOne of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again.

Fox Concepts yet again has made a success and a place I think I will actually return to. \n\nTo start with we had a delicious plate of cheese and meats from the anti pasta menu, along side with some marinated olives and bread w/ olive oil. Just enough to get our taste buds excited and just enough to have my boyfriend (who is not into fancy smancy stuff) say \"give me some more\".  These went nicely with our beers (they've got a great list), my mother's martini (which she seemed to enjoy), and my brother's gin on the rocks (he says they carry a gin that is very rare and delicious but the name didn't stick with me-sorry). \n\nAll of our dinner plates were delicious; fried chicken w/ mashed tatters & biscuits (skin on chicken was a little on the salty side but very crunchy), salmon w/ apple and rice, grilled cheese sliders(who could mess those up?), chicken salad, prime rib dip (served with onion soup instead of au jus, yum yum), and the patato ghesicuto (pasta- I know I can't spell but it was yummy too). Around the table, everyone seemed pretty satisfied.\n\nMy only criticisms would be that we were seating just to the side of the kitchen, enough to be able to look inside. I dig places that leave it open so you can watch your foot and the chefs are aware that the client is aware of whats going on BUT I did watch one man on the end prepare countless dishes without gloves on. He went from cutting and laying out proscuitto onto creating their carmel kettle corn dessert (scooping with bare hands), to setting out what appeared to be the fondue app. Yes, there can be worse things that happen in a restaurant but as someone who has worked in food service, it made me squirm a bit. I suppose that's why it's called Culinary Dropout.\n\n...oh, and the music was a bit too loud for me.

After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.\n\nThe interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).\n\nNo teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.\n\nPrice was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.

We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway. \n\nUnfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway. \n\nWe are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat. \n\nI have enjoyed the pretzels, the now \"famous\" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza. For late night dining they are all very palatable.  I have a funny wing story, but I think it is only funny to me, Dallas, Z, and our friend Peter.  If we ever get the elusive Z to join, I will make sure he shares his story on here.\n\nUntil then, check out Four Peaks in Scottsdale.  The late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet.

If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.\n\nWhile the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.\n\nThe ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.  The lighting for me is too yellow for me, and everything in general seems antiquated.

The broth has a ton of flavor, so when you eat a piece of chicken with the broth it is fine. But to eat it alone, is way too plain. All they need to do is season it up a bit before cooking it. Also, the spring rolls were very fresh and great dipped in the sauce. Without the sauce, they would have been a bit dry, too.

My first time here was opening night and it was ok...the second time was improved...third time good...etc. Now when I come in the smoke is starting to impermiate in the walls leaving a wonderful smokey resonance in the dining room, and the food has become exponentially better!!!\n\nI am like most people in the serious dining population, a lover of all things pork. And while they do some real good pig here, I am thrice impressed with the beef offerings! I like to judge a restaurant on the dishes I would absolutely return for, and the brisket is for sure that item here. Actually, the beef ribs are also one of those \"return for\" items as well. They, much like the brisket, are perfectly smokey, wonderfully seasoned, and impossibly tender. I highly suggest either one.\n\nAs for the sides, I can honestly recommend the collards, potato salad, and the Mac and cheese...although it's not a creamy Mac, but it is gooey enough to pass my palate's stamp of approval. \n\nA huge selling point for me when I dine out are the drink specials, or selection. They are GREAT here!!! Being a total whisky slut, I am in heaven here, with dozens of delicious options, and the handful of beers on tap here make me happy for the change in libation after a few too many. Try the front porch cocktail, one of my top five here in town.\n\nBig Earl's has proven that with time, all things become better.

The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright.  Hence, the main restaurant's name is \"Frank and Albert's.\"\n\nCelebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history.  Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.\n\nWhen visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly.  A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance.  For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet.  The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless.  I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.\n\nSo, my first experience was our dinner at \"Frank and Albert's\", formerly known as the \"Biltmore Grill.\"  Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes.  From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner's Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference.  The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods.  The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their \"bloody rose\" cocktail.  I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail.  However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices.  Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  \n\nNext, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla.  The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property.  It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge.  \n\nAlthough our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies.  We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.\n\nThe room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well.  The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern.  The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins.  Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in.  A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7.  Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar.  I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner.  The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets.  Silky soft...\n\nWe enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.\n\nThe next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge.  Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day.  We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool.  We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.\n\nRecommendations:\ngo to biltmore's website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.\n\nif you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.\n\nAbout Ocatilla:\nbasically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive:\ncomplimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the lounge\nbusiness center (computers, internet, printers)\nWii rentals \npressing service and shoe shine\ntherapeutic turn down bath\nneck and shoulder massages every thursday\npersonal concierge", "type": "review", "business_id": "5Feaj6aixO_QxKFnkHf3xg"}

There, I wrote it...and I am sticking to it. First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress. \n\nWe enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet. \n\nThe service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy. \n\nMaybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free...", "type": "review", "business_id": "-yxfBYGB6SEqszmxJxd97A"}

I ordered the Country fried steak and eggs which comes with OJ, country potatoes and toast as did my sons breakfast which he ordered the standard bacon and eggs with an extra egg. We both agreed that the breakfast was OK, both our potato sides were cold. I had a small thick dollop of gravy on my country fried steak, which was quite good but had to ask for extra gravy. Put in a serving bowl it was so thick it wouldn't pour so I used a spoon. I spread it on my Country fried steak with a butter knife much like you would a piece of toast. Weird! Watch out for the coffee. If you are offered flavored coffee it is extra. Hidden charges for everything. In other words, even with the coupon the total came to almost $20.00. for 2 average breakfasts. (tip, cancer donation, etc.) I had to do a double take on the check to see if they included the coupon. Nothing really bad but nothing really good either. I should have known better! Probably not coming back. My son seconds the motion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fd0iSXEhwz-foQdS8SCKYA"}

Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.\n\nI had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. \n\nBy default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.\n\nThe girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.\n\nI can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back.

Ok, so you're probably saying \"with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?\" Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.  \n\nThe service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill.

After the glowing descriptions on their website, some of the reviews here, and knowing they are located at CityNorth, I expected much better! \n\nWalking in, I did not get the feeling of \"upscale\" restaurant. Sports on 2 TVs blaring out over the bar and into the open dining room did nothing for the atmosphere. They had a long table pulled together for our group in the center of the room, but I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was the first to arrive. Took a few minutes, but the bartender eventually gave me a wine list/menu, answered my questions, and proceeded to get my drink. They had a good selection of wines, and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town.\n\nA few others came in and we moved to the table, no problem transferring tabs. Seemed to take a long time between everyone (about 15 of us, though we initially expected 20) receiving their drinks and the time the first apps came out. Granted, they were complimentary (the deal I worked out for my group), and they were quite yummy - especially the spicy tuna on tempura eggplant - so once we started eating, we forgot about the wait. The pate was very rich and served with soft slices of raisin bread. Some were immediately addicted to the bacon-wrapped dates.\n\nEveryone ordered a burger of one type or another, some opting for the pre-selected toppings, other customizing and adding sweet potato fries. We confirmed that everyone was on separate checks. My burger came out not quite as rare as I would have liked, but what do you expect when the patty is only 1/2\" thick? I am not a big beef fan, anyway. Sauces were good, especially the pungent garlic parm, as were the fries.\n\nBut then, we waited for the checks...and waited...and waited. Seems the staff didn't begin trying to sort out who had what until at least HALF AN HOUR AFTER everyone had finished eating and plates had been cleared! And none clearly knew how to use the POS system. Those who had cash eventually tired of waiting and just left it on the table. Those of us with credit cards were not so lucky...and several bills had to be re-rung, as they did not include the right items. \n\nI had wanted to go back to try the salted caramel milkshake, but it will be a long time before I return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UIfORCz28cEGMr_9p0eJ5g"}

Decor is large heavy curtains and many couches, thus the name The Living Room. However, as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud.

Of course, this is not to imply that Pie-Zanos is staffed by mouth-breathing \"pizza artists\" or stocked with sub-par ingredients and generally filthy.  On the contrary, this \"Subway of Pizza\" is staffed by congenial and hip 20-30 somethings who are eager to please by heaping  tons of fresh and flavorful ingredients  onto your individual personalized pizza. \n\nPie-Zanos allows you to pick from wheat or white dough and from up to 8 different sauces.  From there you can add herbs and crust flavoring and then you can pick from 6-8 different cheeses.  Then you select from the widest selection of pizza toppings you'll find anywhere.   The fare is basically affordable as long as you don't go apeshit on toppings (55 cents each after the first).   As a special bonus they have Pepsi products.   \n\nI have also enjoyed the breadshits which are fresh and delightful and pair nicely with the traditional red marinara as well as the tomato-pesto. \n\nMy only complaints with Pie-Zanos and what keeps it from achieving 5 stars is how busy it gets at lunch, limited indoor seating and the fact that they allow children's birthday parties which, when mixed with ubiquitous bad parenting, quickly turns a hip and snazzy pizza joint into a Chuck-E-Cheese's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Fo5O94HccxE4PvMQf-G_vQ"}

No real options in regards to \"regular\" ball park food, the Brats are a joke and at 6 bucks a pop, they don't even offer peppers and onions, strange that it shows it in the menu picture.

The \"Value\" beer stands..... Okay, when is a beer a \"value\" at 4 dollars, I mean  seriously, being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat that's pretty pathetic I'd at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for. To sum it up, the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 24 ouncer or even better, the 10.50 Corona, HA.\n\n\nHere's the PROS.\n\n1. Damn good deal on seating prices, we sat in section 140 (lower level outfield) for 15 bucks a person, Not too shabby! \n\n2. The stadium is rather beautiful, for a stadium that is. \n\n3. There's a pool in the outfield, cool idea \n\n4. Parking is rather cheap (12 bucks) and has never seemed to be an issue.\n\n5.

CleanFreak has a TON of vacuums, a debugging station, and a fast, very efficient car wash. Best of all, for a mere $17 you can have UNLIMITED car washes. If you have windows, you have probably noticed that it is monsoon season, and monsoons hate clean cars as much as terrorists hate freedom. While I cannot explain why we call monsoons 'haboobs' I can tell you CleanFreak is a great place to wash your car.\n\nCleanFreak has some perks I have never seen at other self car washes. For starters, the employees are outstanding. Somehow they are smiling and seem happy- even in the hot summer heat. They great you and explain how things work, and you get an armor all towel, to clean your interior. As you pull around and queue up for a wash, you are then given your choice of air freshener! Where else does that happen at this price?\n\nI highly recommend checking out the unlimited wash VIP fast pass. There is actually a separate line for people with the fast pass, and how it works is a bar-code sticker is placed on your windshield, and you pull up to the fast pass line, and it scans your pass- and you're in- just like that. This \nsaves time, and waiting in line, which is good stuff.\n\nThe one thing CleanFreak can do a bit better, is communicating how things are supposed to go. On my second visit, I was getting ready to start through the wash, and I asked an employee for an air freshener. He asked me where my receipt was, and I didn't know what he meant. I asked him what receipt and he told me that if you have a Fastpass, you need to bring the recipt that the machine spits out. I had no idea about that, and explained that to him, and he was cool I think it would save some headaches to either have some more signage, or give people a flyer with an overview of what/how to do things. Otherwise, CleanFreak will take care of you, and for the price of one wash somewhere else, you will have a month of unlimited washes.\n\nBring it on monsoons!", "type": "review", "business_id": "wGaFCroINBx3o4L_siYEtw"}

And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out.\n\nFirst things first: they're a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.\n\nThe shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut \"Rumbi rice\".\n\nWe also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.\n\nFor dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.\n\nAll in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and I'll be returning to try and test each one :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "jh9NywTvV-POnF1I6Pc9ng"}

This says it all. Well, almost. While the decor may be a bit \"weird\" and \"puzzling,\" make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.\n\nLet's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?\n\nDINNER:\n\nArrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered \"All Day Happy Hour,\" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their \"Half and Half.\" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. \n\nMy family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. \n\nOverall, the food is average \"bar style\" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. \n\nJUST DRINKS:\n\nNow we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)\n\nAs for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! \n\nSure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. \n\nSO WHY GO? \nUhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)\n\nIf you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-EctXOb3B7T177jGYUhjVA"}

(I won't mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work.

So for those of you that only look at bad reviews, I hope you see this one and have a little more hope.\n\nI had a stylist named Annie, she had pink hair.  Super friendly, and really appeared to want to get my style right.  Since I had read bad reviews before coming in about stylists not listening to the customer when they asked for the curling iron to be used for better curl, I was concerned she would do the same.  But, I let her know I was looking for good curl, and with thin/straight hair, it can be tricky to achieve.  She attempted to curl with just the round brush and hair dryer first, and when she was \"impressed by her curling abilities with a round brush,\" she was \"equally impressed with my hair's inability to hold a curl.\" So she broke out the curling iron!\n\nWe made great small talk, and I let her know I would be back in a month when I go out to celebrate my birthday.\n\nThe salon is a fun, well-decorated environment.  It was pretty loud with the hair dryers going, but not terrible.  The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne, and while I had been offered something to drink, I figured I could just choose water or coffee, as that is usually is what at hair salons, I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff.  Now I know for next time to ask for some bubbly!\n\nAnother good tip is to plan for longer than 45 minutes if you are planning to do a style with curls.  While I got started on my appointment about 5-10 minutes late, I was there for 1 hour (and I dont have super long, thick hair that takes a great deal of time).\n\nI will be back in January for my 25th birthday night!", "type": "review", "business_id": "LcAamvosJu0bcPgEVF-9sQ"}

The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. \n\nIt was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though.

I've eaten here for over a decade. I've brought friends, college classmates, relatives, and dates here. I lost my dad 3 years ago and I have fond memories of dining here with him. I distinctly remember spilling a Coke all over myself the first time I brought him here. I also remember coming here on my very last day of law school, with a bunch of classmates from Employment Law. The folks here have seen their share of special occasions in my life. Wouldn't be true if this were truly just a 2 star experience. \n\nI don't think it's fair to nail a restaurant with a bad review based on only a single visit, in most circumstances. Restaurants are run by humans, who are allowed to have a bad day now and then. I've eaten here a billion times. Occasionally something has annoyed me. Most of the time the service is prompt. And those things are true of every restaurant I've ever frequented more than once. At JOTC, even if it's not prompt, it has not even once been unfriendly. There is an elderly gentleman waiter in particular who I especially like. A non-Indian friend I came here with once asked him, \"So, what part of India are you from?\" The waiter look back puzzled and said in his typically mild and hushed manner, \"Sir, I am from Mexico City.\" We LOL'd. \n\nIt's #2 on my list of Indian restaurants in the Valley, which is pretty good. Since Tandoori Times is so close by it almost always wins out on a given night, over the past year or so. But the fact remains that JOTC is solidly #2. \n\nThe food is good, by my Indian standards. Samosas: awesome. Chicken tikka masala: very good. I tried the bhindi masala once and that didn't turn out too well. A unique JOTC feature is that dishes are served in very cute, traditional-looking, brass or copper Indian pots. \n\nLittle details like that lead me to say that the decor and atmosphere here probably beat out Tandoori Times and every other Indian place. Simple but elegant, with old Indian art on the walls and cool room dividers thoughtfully placed throughout. The outdoor seating is very pleasant, with heaters to warm you up during winter. The location only adds to the reason to eat here. It's in a cool space next to the Scottsdale Civic Center, a few yards away from AZ 88. It's a solid place to come with a group to eat, drink, and enjoy some good conversation.\n\nJOTC doesn't blow me away (thus only 4 stars), but it needs to be said that if you live in the Valley it is worth at least one visit if you like Indian food, which you wouldn't be able to tell from the other reviews.

The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply \"okay\". The buffet didn't have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as I'd have been able to make it (and that's actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare.\n\nFlavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically can't go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally they're nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I don't mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. I've had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived.\n\nAll up, middle of the road as far as I'm concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. I've had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, I'm sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them?\n\nI would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but I'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wife's iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, there's a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didn't have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in India.\n\nI'd eat here again, but only if I'm in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didn't measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and I've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian. Three and a half, rounded up to four, Seacrest out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PsKAMRgeydy54ytW8xWKCw"}

We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34! \n\nMy 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers.

It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!\n\nPreviously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it.

You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.\n\n\nIt's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.\n\nWhen they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.\n\nFar from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1oFvqm7eSpJbVpxpPxueaA"}

That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.\n\nThe 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American\n\nWhat makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again\n\nFor me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SX0pCDRvuTEoXobTovJEIQ"}

Got a great deal from Priceline, and I pretty much knew what to expect going in. I've stayed at places like this before across the country, and I can definitely say that this was a very pleasant experience. Everyone has complained about the beds being hard, but I didn't really find this to be the case. I like a firmer mattress, so I guess that's just my personal preference, but it wasn't like sleeping on a campus futon or anything. The towels were nice- nothing fancy, but definitely not the thin washed-out wisps of cloth that you might have expected at other places. The setup of the place was great- it's just like having a little studio apartment. Even had a coffeemaker, and an ironing board, which is strangely becoming a rarity these days.\n\nI have to make special mention of one thing- the pillows, for some reason, were absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I both agreed (and we're both flight attendants, so we KNOW hotels) that these were some of the best hotel pillows we've ever slept on. Couldn't exactly tell you why, but there was just something about them- proper amount of spring, cushioning, support, punchability, etc. \n\nIf you need to be in Arizona on business, you couldn't pick a better place. The convenience is amazing- you're right near the highway and there's quite a bit of stuff within walking distance. We got some DELICIOUS takeout from some of the local restaurants, and it was SUPER Handy to have a microwave and kitchenette available within the room for our use!\n\nSo yeah, I gotta say, I didn't mind this place one tiny little bit. If you're used to Marriotts, Hyatts, and other fancy hotels, then you need to know that this isn't one of them.

Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.\n\nNow for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry \"shooters\" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!\n\nWe didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.

The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.

When she was asked about the \"specials\", she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know about the ingredients or sides that were available.  I was still hanging in there and giving this place my all.  Afterall... she could have been new, having a terrible day OR goodness knows what she was going through that day?  Then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and every server in the place ran for the hills, leaving the issue unaddressed.  PEOPLE!... if you have a crying baby, FOR THE LOVE... take the poor little thing outside and deal with the problem, don't force unsuspecting strangers to listen to it.  We opted for a changed of scenery within the restaurant after five minutes of non-stop crying and were moved into the main area of the restaurant and reassigned to a new server.\n\nShe no sooner finished warming my coffee (I use this term loosely, as it was more like colored water) before I glanced into the grill area which open for the whole restaurant to see.  This was the nightmare... I saw a rather large female cook with a tissue paper plug in her nose.  Anyone who's ever had a bloody nose knows that this is one of the few things you can do to passify the DRIPPING BLOOD!!  You would think a bloody nose would qualify one for a break until the bleeding subsided, wouldn't you??\n\nI don't think i'll be able to bring myself to visit this place again!!  In the mean time... might I suggest some food safety training??", "type": "review", "business_id": "H03D-h5UwPXOv64W5Iqn_Q"}

BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda. \nIt was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger. \nFor Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for.

We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:\n\nService: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small\nin seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.\n\nDrinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.\n\nrecommended Food:\nFish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.\nSandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss\nmeatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.\nTacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.\nCream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.\nSteak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.\nAppetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.\n\n\nPricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz.

This is definitely \"family food.\" Most adults won't complain about it, and kids will enjoy the simplicity. I recently had the Old Spaghetti Factory's Chicken Parm. I won't call it bland, but it's nothing that the average home chef couldn't cook up for their family. \n\nI will give the place credit for the portions. It's not expensive and you get a lot of food. While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad. The salad was way too plain for my taste, but at least I had a little bit of vegetables to go with my meal. It's also quick.

I had decided on mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) w/ mixed mushrooms, hamachi sashimi w/ jalapenos and ribeye sumibiyaki. First up was the hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeno slices. Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they weren't packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that there's a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasn't a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I don't get salmonella. If you don't hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASU'S THAT DID ME IN!\n\nAnyhow, next up was the mirugai w/ mixed mushrooms dish. Very small portion, but it was tasty. They were a bit skimpy on the mirugai to mushroom ratio so that was a little disappointing. About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if I'm all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to \"cut\" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but that's just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki. \n\nSince I had a $50 gift card (that I purchased from the radio promos for $25), I had another $10 to use up so I ordered the shrimp skewers wrapped in crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were like deep fried chow mein noodles. Interesting, but good. \n\nStuffed like a pig, I paid and waddled out w/ my leftovers in tow.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KBG28p3lGX17hOPoHhq5PQ"}

So I don't really mind the price for a once in a while kind of thing.  My hubbie and I have been 8-10 times... twice at the Scottsdale location.\n\nThe husband and I always order the \"Big Night Out,\" generally the \"Lobster Indulgence.\"  (We figure if we're going to spend a pretty penny, we might as well really make it worthwhile.)  Maybe since we always do the lobster thing, the price doesn't bother me as much.\n\nDon't remember the specific themes the times we went to Scottsdale, but the \"Big Night Out\" meals go like this:  Cheese Fondue (you can choose the special or any from the regular menu) with assorted dippers, Salad Course (again, the special or off the menu), Main Course (if you get the \"Lobster Indulgence,\" it includes twin lobster tails, usually a couple kinds of beef (e.g., filet and sirloin), shrimp, chicken, salmon, and/or pork, often a stuffed pasta, and lost of vegetables) with assorted sauces, and the best part... Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruit, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies Treats, etc.  Yummy!\n\nI must say that your experience also really depends on your server.  If you get a bogus one, you might not have a great time.  We've had good experiences for the most part, some absolutely awesome experiences.\n\nAlso, check out each location's web site prior to making reservations.

Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with \"sliders\" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the A1 Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible.\n\nSince we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.

And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you.\n\nThere were a few people in our group that opted for the bull ride, a nice little touch that gave this place that little something extra to set it apart from the other Old Town places.

They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!\nThis is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. \n1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.\nI am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry \"panang\" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.\nI must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's.\nTott's even has excellent Won Ton soup.

And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.\n\nMuch like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.\n\nWe always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  \n\nThere are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.\n\nThe people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.\n\nParking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot \"across the street\" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.\n\nSo, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.

There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were \"socializing\" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "7lbvsGKzhjuX3oJtaXJvOg"}

THANK GOD.  I have been looking for a restaurant like this since I left Chicago 5 years ago.  The style was perfect, the prices were not exorbitant, the food was delicious, the service was tremendous.\n\nWe had a table at 7, and even though we Happy Hour had passed, they still let us order off of the happy hour menu, so we had four courses for $30 a piece.  We started with Spinach Artichoke DIp, each had a salad (I had the Bacon/Bleu Cheese/Walnut - YUM), then I had the Balsamic Ribeye...  It was so delicious.  \n\nOne complaint, half of my steak was medium, a quarter was rare, and the other quarter was practically blue, but it still tasted great.  Oh - and the carrots were a little too sweet for me...  They tasted like sweet potatoes....\n\nAnyway...  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was the best damned bread pudding I have ever had.  Add in the drinks (which were tasty) and our bill was still nothing too crazy.\n\nOur server was just the right combination of hands off and hands on, and i dug her big time.  We ended up having a long leisurely meal, were there from 7-9, but it didn't feel like we were there a long time.  It was just a nice relaxing meal...\n\nLoved it - best restaurant experience I've had since I moved here three years ago.

I've come here a lot with friends late night, and the food was always scrumptious and service excellent, but after last night I MUST PROTEST.\n\nI ordered the Bourbon BBQ Wings, a promising title appealing to my tastes exactly. They arrive with a generous bowl of ranch and a few stalks of celery. I know most people don't eat the celery, maybe that's why, so I guess carrots were out of the question.\n\nTHE WINGS WERE FROM BABY CHICKENS!!!\nI was shocked. some of them (both sections) were not 1.5 inches long, I swear.

I want so much to write a glowing review here but NO.\n\nSo my friend got the Southwestern eggrolls. They were sliced open diagonally and nicely presented on the plate. I tried one, and eventually my friend let me have the last 2. They were hard and irritating to eat, and tasted fine for tourists as it reminded me of Rubio's or Arriba's standard. I think Jack In The Box could've put out a better product overall.\n\nAnother friend got the chicken quesedilla.\nAlthough I didn't taste it, presentation looked nice with the pico and guac on the side. The quesedillas were a good size and thickness. My friend took half of it home.\n\nI can recommend the burgers, onion rings, and breakfasts.\n\nPrices went up a couple of years ago to an average $9.49 for a burger plate, and slightly less for appetizers and other things. Service is always good, but don't go if you're in a hurry and the place is packed.\n\nBOTTOM LINE.... choose wisely. Last night I chose....

As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  \"Cool!\" as I exclaimed to myself. \n\nIt looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entr\u00e9e caught my attention! Content I was! j'adore Chimis!\n\nAfter being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer.\n\nNot too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus.\n\nNow come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut!\n\nThe beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side.\n\nThe Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint.\n\nNothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late.\n\nI explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that.\n\nI really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either.\n\nI guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?

They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway. \n\nFor the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow. \n\nThe replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds). \n\nEvery Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them.

We decided to start with the calamari which was just ok but I am more partial to the fried versions so that could have been part of the problem it was a little on the rubbery side and wasn't packed full of flavor. The bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best breads I have ever had. It also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari. For dinner I decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 3.5/5 stars. It had decent flavor but I definitely have had better. The potatoes were very delicious though :) My friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasn't gamey and fell right off the bone which was great. It had good flavor but once again I have had better. For desert I got the pear/almond pastry(tart? can't remember) and it was absolutely amazing!! Soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size. My friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall I don't think I would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high.\n\nThis was a very cute restaurant and the staff was wonderful and very helpful.

I have been to the theater to see the Nutcracker when I was a kid and I saw the Lion King in New York when I was a kid as well. I remember them being fun, but that's about the extent of my memories of the theater. There happened to be a groupon for the play \"The Mystery of Irma Vep\" that my mom purchased for the four of us (mom, myself, husband, sister) to attend. \n\nWe got there a bit early after dinner and walked around the theater looking at the art that was up around the building. There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasn't dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans. \n\nHowever the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black \"Friday\" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didn't get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didn't get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it. \n\nAfter coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon. All of us really enjoyed this, and I was surprised my husband liked this as much as he did. A good time had by all!", "type": "review", "business_id": "RA2EuX04SHqmayKpLhpNvA"}

We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zMa6YoEekpABg1HZnnTZdg"}

As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! \n\nWhile I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. \n\nIn summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: \n\n- The very friendly staff\n- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! \n- Clean decor \n- Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see \n- A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. \n\nI'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. \n\nDirections: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!", "type": "review", "business_id": "kEyCMHBnohaWc81omLDfYg"}

No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.\n\n I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! \n\nBut the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. \"Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right.\" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up \"hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up\". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that. \n\nPs. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again", "type": "review", "business_id": "u_F86yMy2iOVQXhLJoxj2A"}

Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.\n\nSo you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.

There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.  \n\nFirst challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didn't look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away!\n\nSometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasn't all that.  \n\nIf you decide to go to Chestnut Lane, maybe you could park in the spacious Jack-in-the Box lot just to the east.  And grab a Breakfast Jack to hold you over during your long wait!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JW6fDZOuUKtJyZGeldh0xA"}

Still loving the appetizers and the cider.  This time had the  cottage pie,  it's  really nothing to write home about, specially if you are from the region and your parent's wouldn't appreciate you seeing other cottage pies;)    Spend the extra on the sheperds  it's really much better.   This was ok , really really nothing special and the heat could have been better.   Service  is good, but pedestrian , the last time I had no time pressure, this time I did.     We're sitting at 3.5 - 3.75 now with the round up till 4. Still  I'll return\n \n\nOriginal Review:\n First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better. \nCider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar. \n\nOnto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)  \nAppetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.   \n \nThe  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names. \n\nMain: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.  \n\nBread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car. \n\nOddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on. It's as good  for food as any of the valley's Irish bars ( better imho)  but have to get back on pub quiz night  to really know.\n\nWere in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa, the space and  know it's going to sound  bad ( place looks like standing wave city)  with anything electric and full drum set.     The jukebox played \"i'm too sexy \" by Right said fred  WTF that really  messed up the ambience.Country bars don't have NIN on the box after all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BpSLpzq_NRYghGSsb10G3A"}

However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried. \n\nYes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).\n\nRegarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that! \n\nOther pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LYyGQgL60VKdV-p_9OxmWQ"}

Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.  \n\nI am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.\n\nThe menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.\n\nThe dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like \"I like it loose, like my women,\" is just not funny.\n\nAnyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qXQ3ZBdwI3GlbR5-eYWqNA"}

Except, I guess, I can tell you why I like this place. I like it for two glorious words: HAPPY + HOUR. \n\nYes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though. \n\nAlso, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough. \n\nIf I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.\n\nIt's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.\n\nWORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS:\nTry their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people.

I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.\n\nWe ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much \"wrapper\" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.\n\nI still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.  I noticed some wine bottles in the back when I was picking up my food so that may entice me to dine-in at some point as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ujLZmyy11g1JHCQTxRA3Dw"}

Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). \n\nI roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar? \n\nOn and on it went. \n\nMy final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal. \n\nPrices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list).

At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.\n\nThey have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.\n\nThe service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).\n\nNow, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.\n\nI am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of.

Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials. \n\"Come back Tuesday or Thursday or just give us a call and we'll check if it's in...\"   \nI can walk to Jerry's in less than 10 mins but I would rather go to AZ Art or anywhere else than have to call everytime I need some stuff.  I can go to AZ Art in Tempe and when something is out can order from their mother store and it's there the next day.  \n\nThe clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they don't really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company.\nThey do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff.\nI spoke to a gal there who was really chatting me up on her recent art night where she painted this huge piece and blah blah blah but when I asked if she knew when they might have more of the brush tip markers she was mum.   \"No clue.\" \nJerry's, just clean it up and have your people act toward you and your customers with the same passion they have with their own art.  Do this and I will try to like you again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cqXv3w9Mf-aVi4PPRspfFQ"}

I can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin' environment, which is nice, depending on your mood.\n\nOh and they have those satellite speaker things so you have this box at your table and you can tune the sound to whichever game you're interested in listening to, not that it matters when the band is playing, but every other time it's cool.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4NpEP2sTOxm4Cw1SuXuGRQ"}

I have been to this location 4 times with each visit hoping the previous one was a fluke.  I always would get their flagship item as well, wings.  I like the spicy garlic which I find as the best balance between flavor and heat.  Each time the chicken was either overcooked, under sauced, or both.  Why can't they do their staple item right each and every time?  Major disappointment, times 4.\n\nI won't elaborate on the other shortcomings of this location because they are too many.  The bullet points are that the service is very lackadaisical with anything.  You sit down waiting longer for the service to take your order than it takes to get it out to you.  On multiple occasions a buddy of mine who I went with each time felt compelled to recite Reservoir Dogs lines when it came to drink refills.  They were few and far between.  Finally, I don't sit at the bar because I like to speak with the company I am in, but that was virtually impossible.  This wasn't just on event nights either.  The volume of the speakers didn't vary anytime, not even in the middle of the week during lunch.\n\nI want a good Buffalo Wild Wings in my area badly.

It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud. \n\nEven for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. I'm glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender. \n\nAfter a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud. \n\nOn to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning. \n\nFor dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.\n\nI'm pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizza's later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that!\n\nMy major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose.

That would be ME. \n\nIn search for a cute independently owned cupcakery to test how AZ cupcakes stack up to SF Bay cuppies... we headed to downtown Scottsale. WELL, not really for the cupcakes, but just to check it out. However, seeing there were a handful of cupcakeries nearby, we had to try one.\n\nBUT the reviews of 2 and 3 stars for some of these places seriously put me off. I hate dry cupcakes and I was not eager to spend precious calories on something that would not satisfy. Sprinkles had the better reviews and whala it was open after all the other places closed. (Note to self, who closes a bakery at 6pm? Cupcake freaks come out at NIGHT!)\n\nWe have a Sprinkles about a 15 min drive from us@home, but have I ever gone??? NO. So yes here we are at Sprinkles in AZ. The gals are friendly, they answer my questions tirelessly. I end up with 2, lemon and chocolate marshmallow.\n\nThey stay overnight in our hotel room since our dinner left absolutely no room for cupcakes. I was worried they'd be dry and stale the next morning when I busted them out at 7am before my workout. Gotta get some carbs in so I can burn them off right?\n\nBottom line... Sprinkles may not be a cute little indy shop any longer but their stuff is solid. No mixes, the dark chocolate cupcakes are the perfect combo of dark, bitter, and sweet. The lemon was dense, I think mine is better, but the chocolate marshmallow OMG. It was like a grownup version of a Hostess cupcake, MY FAVORITE. Despite their overnight rest, they were not dry, the result of a fair amount of oil if the residue on my fingers was any indication.\n\nPlease send me three dozen of the Chocolate Marshmallow please. I will love you forever. Thanks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AqbgC7Gul5Es1rRzGNLDFA"}

I had the basil-gin-strawberry drink and it was deeeelishhhh. My husband had a tasty IPA he has never had before. \n\nService was good. Our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant. \n\nWhen it comes to food, my husband and I had different experiences. He had the Vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding. It is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time. \n\nVegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich. I had the veggie sandwich which was decent but I wasn't impressed. Although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall. The foccacia was a little too doughy. And the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized. The french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly. I think next time I will ask if I can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu. With a side of their yummy spicy mayo.\n\nTalking about kids menu, that was another miss. Having a stepson myself, I appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly. However there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game. The kids dominated the bocce court and were loud, rude, and obnoxious. The parents were enjoying their cocktails and ignored their kids behavior. It kind of ruined the mood for us. I wish they would have just gone to Peter Piper like most kids teams do after a game...\n\nWe do really want to return. Maybe for happy hour or brunch. I want to try their bloody marys and the Amber Scramble. We might even take our kid. But don't worry- he will be well supervised! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "WS1z1OAR0tRl4FsjdTGUFQ"}

There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly. \n\nI requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside.\n\nIn a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger. \n\nThe order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good.\n\nThe highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it.\n\nMy boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash.\n\nScramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley.

This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.

That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My \"veggie\" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. \n\nEggplant.\n\nOhhhhkay then. \n\nIt was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.\n\nSo, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours. \n\nJust UGH in every way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PwxvN0SnAGPdqXdNEYVT3g"}

Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?\n\nCase in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said \"SURE!\" It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? \"SURE! But be careful it's hot.\" And oh so YUM!\n\nI think they deserve the taglines \"Have it your way\" and \"Any way you want it\" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said \"No\" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.\n\nAdd to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.\n\nBut wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.\n\nMy only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.\n\nI'll tea back REAL SOON!", "type": "review", "business_id": "gWQlTK3o29rZGlw2YLUnhA"}

I couldn't finish either of the latter types of bruschetta. \n\nOnto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage.

Located at the bottom of Artisan condos, it's not a terribly easy place to see if you're driving by. They feature an incredible selection of wines and cheeses, of which you can purchase and take home as well as nosh in the restaurant. They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night.\n\nA particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork. They are definitely delicious. Also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops. \n\nThere is nothing here that is oddly unique, but everything is interesting, and it is a nice spot to hang out with friends and have a nice night out.

His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.\n\nAt the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. \n\nAlthough Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. \n\nWhen my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.\n\nRecently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership. \n\nThe inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable.

But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. \nMy decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. \nWhen we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another \"slice of heaven\". \nAnd so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, \"Well, the wait hasn't changed\". \nBob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, \"Are you cooking tonight?\" To which he replied, \"No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore.\" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. \nAt 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! \nSo what makes for the \"best pizza in America\" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!", "type": "review", "business_id": "VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ"}

The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.

I always force myself to save the second half and it makes me much less sleepy when I head back to work after lunch :) Plus it makes great leftovers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WNy1uzcmm_UHmTyR--o5IA"}

They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish.

We discussed several times that we should maybe install one at the house!!  It was just great to get in a soak after a long day of touring.\n\nWe also really liked the restaurant on site.  There's not much to choose from in terms of eats in Apache Junction but the Kokopelli's was really nice.  I had a delicious salad with strawberries, blue cheese, and grilled chicken one night and fish over pasta the next.  Both were fabulous.  There was live music and the service was really good.  We met some super interesting people and so the conversation was flowing.

We started with two salads: the prosciutto, zucchini, and artichoke (my favorite) and the goat cheese and pear... also quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with either one.  We then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas.  Yum!  The thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect!  \n\nAlong the way, owner Julian Wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - he's fantastic!  While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her.\n\nWe had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess I'll have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.  \n\nI have a feeling it won't take me as long to return to La Bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place.

I imagine that they have magnificent views of the desert and mountains when it's still light out. The dining room is pretty small, so I'd recommend reservations. If you can't get reservations, I'd caution against dining in the lounge. Although they serve the full menu there, the lounge is actually in its own room and usually pretty empty, so it would detract from the whole experience. The service here is pretty close to perfect - these are professionals, the kind of staff that's trained to stop and step aside as you walk past them, even if they're not in your way at all. The gourmet cuisine here is great - not as inventive as Binkley's, but just as well executed. The menu changes often, so I can't really recommend any particular dishes, other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup, the one dish that's always on the menu. I would not recommend ordering their foie gras, if it's on the menu. It was the only dish that really missed the mark. I've only had foie gras one other time before, at Picasso in Vegas, so I don't have that much of a basis of comparison, but the foie gras at Mosaic was way inferior to Picasso's phenomenal foie gras (my understanding is that the best foie gras should be firm, smooth, a little buttery - there's here was watery and blubbery).

The bar was flowing, both dining areas were filled with people and the entry area was bustling. \n\nAs we waited for our table, Muhammed Ali walked in with his wife and family members. That was a huge highlight. This place is rich with sports memorbillia and players often eat here after a game. Only odd thing was our waitress told us after that the Brewers Manager was also dining in the next room and that we could walk over there if wanted to. I am a super fan of baseball, but even I know the limits of someone's personal space. \n\nWe each ordered a few appetizers, bottle of wine and some salads before our entrees. I ordered the 10 oz ribeye and it was delicous. We ordered a side of mac and cheese and it had lots of flavor.  This place is fun because of the sporting atmosphere, fans, players, coaches, etc. and it's walkable from Downtown Scottsdale. \n\nI'd definitely go back here again next year. For all the ladies, this place is a must visit for some great eye candy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bc-lE-wGVAsUrX-kJhtY-Q"}

Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.\n\nDetail:\n\nLike I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.\n\nI have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.\n\nIt's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.\n\nTwo friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.\n\nThis is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QxEUzbLfCTXF6gHWJegWgw"}

Since then I have seen Rembrandt, special guests; The Tudor Tailors, Diego Rivera (with Frida Kahlo),  Author Michael Blake (with His Son) and much more.  As far as being, Good for Kids?!  My granddaughter, Jade's love of going to the P A M has made Me a bigger fan than ever.  ~Please View Pictures~", "type": "review", "business_id": "u0NbikWwP7TVkMkCily-4g"}

Sometimes it's hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more. \n\nStarting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine. \n\nI have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.\n\nThe \"Shooters\" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. \n\nIf you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey \"Chop\" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. \n\nThe center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious. \n\nWhile the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn't one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VKNl2-aF4n1x7lPVyU-Mag"}

The portion was pretty good for the $8. But the chicken had a tuna-texture I wasn't expecting. But the greens tasted fresh and there was just enough dressing for my preference. I haven't tried anything else beyond a chai latte which was pretty standard. Some of their pastries look good but I wonder if the muffins are from Costco. \n\nI give this place one star for atmosphere. Each seating area is decorated a little differently.

They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.

It's awkward to overhear their conversations.  \n\nThe service seemed a bit lackluster.  It was almost as if they were not intrested in a big group coming in.  Our server was pretty good, but not overly friendly.  I will definately try this place again and update.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Y293fHh5SZ0_9BZm4M6BCg"}

I read something about an ice cave, live comedy, hanging man meat, and surveillance cameras, but despite these oddities what drew me in was the promise of expertly crafted crepes and the opportunity to see the chefs do their stuff on a closed circuit TV.\n\nLe Chalet did not disappoint. Sit in the front dining area to view the chefs at work in the open kitchen, or take a seat in the dining area by the bar where two flat screens showcase the action at the crepe griddles. The Bretonne crepe with ham, mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and a sunny-side up egg was superb, and I can't wait to go back and try the La Landaise, blinis topped with seared fois gras, apple, and balsamic glaze.\n\nI also tried La Potence (the \"hanging man\"), filet medallions served on a medieval looking mace, seared tableside with bourbon and served with a pineapple slice, rice, and some mayo-based dipping sauces. Thoroughly enjoyable, but next time I would opt instead for a cheese fondue or the melted Raclette plate with cured meats, which looked delicious.\n\nThe ambiance seemed a bit strange to me, but homey and comfortable. And yes, there is a sculpted ice cave for performances, The night I attended was slated for \"clean comedy\" and I made it a point to get out of there despite some morbid curiosity (I'm not an amateur comedy fan, and the idea of family-friendly comedy made me even more anxious).\n\nThe handsome server was very attentive and knowledgeable, and I loved the half-carafe option when ordering wine.

In body I was there, however my mind was suffering under an oppressive weight called alcohol that blurred pretty much every little thing that happened.\n\nFor example: did I really find myself screaming piano man at the top of my lungs, to rapturous applause from the rest of the bar?  every time I tried to stop, I was goaded forth into the next verse?  (did the piano indeed sound like a carnival?)\n\nWas I really and truly told assuredly that I was gay?  Did I really have an argument for what felt like hours with a fair-eyed girl who has severe trust issues and one fucked up gaydar?  despite the wedding ring and total pudgy married-guy look did I still come across as gay?  (my wife tells me that it can only be the broadway rendition of a billy joel song.  I begrudgingly concede)\n\nDid I really hear someone who claimed to be a teacher misrepresent the very definition of a parallelogram?  Did she really say that a parallelogram could not have right angles?  Did I really scoff right at her and throw down the argument-crushing example of the square (QED biatch!)?  Evidently I did, because I do remember her backing me into a corner and beating my ass with a relentless barrage of haymakers, both rights and lefts, that left me bruised like a second-rate (albeit mathematically-savvy) prizefighter the next day.  Her-110 lbs at the very most, me twice that and then some on the most gravitationally-forgiving day, and I had no response but to cower in my own fucked-up rendition of the rope-a-dope.\n\nHer: \"flex your stomach so I can hit you.\"\nMe: \"Are you joking?  that's me, flexing.\"  (#fat)\n\nso I can tell you little to nothing about turf--I genuinely can't say for sure if that was the place we were at.

That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)\n\nThe quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  \n\nWe had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.\n\nWe had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.\n\nWe asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.\n\nSome tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  \n\nI'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:\n\n1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  \n\n2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.\n\nVerdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BINYfrtGp3A4w0d5E7kbYw"}

We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.\n\nThis place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.\n\nThe selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.\n\nOur server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.\n\nA couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:\n\nDisorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it.\nAmbience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60\" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41j3GB7M-Lwq284Pfb9zgw"}

Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). \n\nSo, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: \n\n1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html \n\n2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. \n\n3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. \n\n4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. \n\n5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. \n\nOh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. \n\nOh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship). \n \nLe sigh... \n\nOpen T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm", "type": "review", "business_id": "DTFy9-NuZBjBEd9Zcoo94g"}

Libraries are my mecca. But, I'm picky. \n\nGetting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. \n\nOnce I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. \n\nSo far, so good.\n\nBut then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. \n\nDon't get me wrong. This isn't rocket science. It's also not pop rocks. \n\nHaving found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online? Bonus!\n\nMy first trip to the library was GREAT. \n\nThen the second one came. The library had NONE of the books I came looking for, and I was prepared to find AT LEAST ONE of the books on my list of 5. Nope. So I put some \"on hold\" for me and wandered about, very disappointed. That's when I began to dislike this library. None of my books? Really? \n\nThis library isn't browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. In fact, I miss that ol' library, with its shelves of poetry, psychology, magazines and literature... so easy to find, so easy to browse, so easy to sit for hours and read. \n\nI couldn't leave SPL fast enough. On my way out, a man working (volunteering?) there showed me how to use the self-service check-out system. Nice! He was a friendly ol' man, who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines... and probably doubted my ability to read, for he explained step-by-step what I needed to do in order to check out my books. At least the lesson was in-depth enough for me to fully comprehend - and then some. \n\nSo, the next time I went to SPL - to pick up the books I had put on hold (score!) - I used the self-service check-out. I was in and out in like 7.46 minutes. \n\nSo, let's recap:\n*SLP has books!\n*SLP doesn't always have the books you want. (Sad face)\n*You can renew online, create a profile and share reviews. \n*You can place books on-hold from any computer, if you're logged into your account.\n*People working there are friendly.\n*It's easy to get a card. Just bring in your SRP bill, like I did. \n*It's not an easy place to browse.\n*SPL doesn't make you feel like you want to spend hours there.\n*There are private rooms; just not sure how you reserve them.\n*There are monthly activities at the library - but mostly about old-fart diets and how to use Microsoft Word. \n*There's FREE parking in THE SHADE! \n*You can check your items out yourself, with their self-service check-out machine. \n*It's pretty ugly inside - brown, biege, dull and lifeless.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oFW8Fjszgsmy39a5hUnoBQ"}

Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1\") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3\" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH!

We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only 1 person in line in front of us.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.   \n\n...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.  But by God it wasn't good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.\n\nThe funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.

Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisu's rounds, brownies, canoli's (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisu's Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it.

The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IWwt0vm8lYbVoyGSPd2Z9A"}

It was quite busy, which probably shouldn't of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P. \n\nAnyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there. \n\nOnce we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. \n\nSince it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. \n\nAs for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. \n\nAt the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. \n\nThey have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch. \n\nFor the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TMZP6Kzkc-FytzgbgIC9JA"}

The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.\n\nA lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special \"Chinese cakes\" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  \n\nIf you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.

He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie??? I don't understand at all, you take it off the bill because you screwed up, but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for.

Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of \"big things in small packages,\" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.\n\nMoving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's \"Signature\" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.\n\nAt this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.\n\nIf there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the \"Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,\" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.\n\nMoving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the \"French Napoleon\" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see \"Mille Feuille New York\") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eTbtfgUtfewdncgVf2CbWw"}

We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling. \n\nKathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces. \n\nThere are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors. \n\nThe volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.\n\nIt was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them", "type": "review", "business_id": "mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA"}

No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  \n\nI have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.

Yes, because it is true -- this is not Postino, and for that matter, this is not Kaz. It is a good, local spot to grab a glass of wine, maybe even with your mom, who may not be hip enough to chill at Postino on Central (which really requires little hipness, I mean they let me in), or your dad, who may not be able to read in the dark at Kaz, or maybe for that friend from Gilbert, who you know, wants to walk the wide straight path of predictability. \n\nPredictability isn't bad...in this case, that means a good wine selection (could rotate more), full bar, usually one good draft or two out of 5, decent cocktails, and decent food. The food is not really what you come for. The bruschetta is sub par, but the salads are above par. And, I have to add, hummus with no flat bread or pita?? No. No pita for you! \n\nService runs from friendly (read, management) to disillusioned and inattentive. The latter tends to happen if you sit outside. The last time I was in, I think grapes were crushed, olives were pressed, and chickpeas were ground...at least they could have been. \n\nOften they have live music too, which runs from the somewhat awkward jazz guy who keeps talking to you to the Motown wedding singer -- which on at least one occasion brought out near Elaine Benes-style dancing -- now that was worth the visit and waiting for the grape crushing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "s1dex3Z3QoqiK7V-zXUgAw"}

The guy who answered the phone said that due to a downed gas line in the area they couldn't operate, but their Mesa store would deliver to me for no extra charge since I couldn't come pick it up like I wanted to. I said this would be fine, placed my order, and the guy said it would be about 45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, but I figured it was just because it was coming from Mesa. \n\nWhen it finally arrived, I was starving, so I opened the food immediately, only to find out that my Panang CHICKEN was nothing but sauce and a few carrots and bell peppers. On top of this, I had been charged a delivery fee when they said I wouldn't, and I was charged for chicken when I got none. I called back immediately to tell them my food did not have any chicken in it, but was only sauce and a couple vegetables. They informed me that they were very busy and would not be able to bring me another order that night, but I could call back the next day (today) and they would bring me another order. I was upset and hoped that for all the trouble the food was at least good. Well, it was. The panang sauce was very delicious and perfectly spicy. Although it was not made the way I ordered it, I could still tell that it was very good and I would definitely order it again. \n\nToday, I called back and they brought me a new order, this time of Spicy Eggplant with chicken since I had already had to eat the panang I ended up with last night and didn't want that again at this point. They were very nice about making it right, and they delivered it to me again at no charge and credited back the charge they made last night. Delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes again even though he had said 45 and this location is about a mile from where I live, so if you order delivery expect a bit of a wait. As for the Spicy Eggplant with chicken, it was REALLY delicious. The eggplant tasted like some of the best I've ever had, not mushy but not firm, and I finally got my chicken and yes, it was very good. SO in conclusion, the food is great but I hope that they are more organized when they aren't having technical difficulties. Probably won't have them deliver again but I would definitely order from here again. If there hadn't been all the problems I would give them 4 stars but the fact that I couldn't even get my order corrected that night was upsetting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "km3g-wDO2KfhfnTvJrLJig"}

I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.  \n\nSo, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.

I can't remember how many times they lost my work orders so I'd have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment! The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldn't turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals, and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously p'd them off. The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her, too. One time, they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment, we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage! it was a total nightmare.

The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food. Great concept for something different. For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink). It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie. Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table. I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl). The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it. Enough to make me sweat a little. One thing that I noticed was that the employee's were really good about keeping the place clean.

From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. \n\nWith two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. \n\nIn the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. \n\nA bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. \n\nThe Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   \n\nPerfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. \n\nApple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. \n\nWhile Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7LGjM8HKJTwqfYU3C7N_0w"}

I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "cWnISQaO33CwpQRPcq6nIg"}

Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds.\nIt seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....\n\nI chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.\n\nFirst, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:\n1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??\n2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.\n3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.\n\nAt the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?\nAnyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.\n\nI finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.\nWTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.\n\nAt this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.\n\nI couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!\n\nExactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea\n\nI haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!\n\nNo.  NO.

But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. \n\nSo, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. \n\nBut it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. \n\nI pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. \"Wow,\" I thought, \"It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying.\" \n\nSo, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. \n\nThinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. \n\nOnly, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. \n\nStupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again. \n\n\n(Disclaimer: Said writer of review graduated high school with a 3.98 G.P.A  and attended a well accredited college of her choice, where you went on to graduate with honors, having made the Dean's and President's Honor roll more than once.

The odd, also very good, part about that menu is the salad selection. Duke's has two pages of its menu dedicated to salads. While not something you'd expect from a sports bar, it's nice to know that there still is a healthy selection I can choose from while watching a game.\n\nAnother cool feature is Duke's \"No DUI Car.\"  It'll take you to your next destination.

Be prepared to buy more than you wanted if you only have plastic - they have a minimum of $6 to use your card so I had to buy two sodas I didn't want in order to get my handful of candy. \nWith all that said, this is a really nice, unique local business and I love the idea behind it, but I don't have a lot of free cash to spend on a bag of gummy bears I can buy at Circle K for $2 less.

You will not see any dough-nuts being made here which is sort of part of what the Krispy Kreme experience should be. Seeing them being made; ordering them as they come out so they are still warm for your first bite.\n\nNow then let's consider this review then as if this was a regular dough-nut shop and it also does not stand up. The mom-and-pop  shop I have closer to me makes better tasting ones, but it is probably because they make them right then and there.\n\nI am assuming that they are hauling the ones they do sell here from a different location or a centralized place where they make them, which completely explains why the glazes, etc. taste as if they have been sitting for a while. They are still ok dough-nuts.\n\nThe other thing that this place lacks is in the coffee. I ordered a coffee and the person had one of those Super-sized Shamrock farms half-and-half containers and asked us if I'd like some in my coffee and to tell her when to stop. I am sorry but, who puts anything on their coffee without even tasting it first. Not me that's for sure.

I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at \"across the street\" way too much, and I'm getting tired of always having the same thing.\n\nAt just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, I'll be a regular.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h7hr0v3E1ulU2sXNItD5UQ"}

I sat down with Heather, the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist. She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry. There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda, which is always annoying. Then the scary part... the dental work. It was uncomfortable and I hated it, but soon it was over, it wasn't that bad and I felt a thousand times better. Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of. Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price! But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than I'd been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems. In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isn't a dentist looking to take advantage of you. I couldn't have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office. The convenient downtown location only makes it better. I will never go to another dentist again and I'm actually looking forward to my next appointment. I can't recommend this office enough.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-_0Dx-cEvnQ0w2mauUpyXA"}

I made the 1.5 hour drive from Tucson to watch Avatar at Arizona Mills, and my friends and I decided to grab a bite before heading back.  We randomly drove down Baseline and pretty much stumbled upon this place.  Traffic going westbound towards the 10 was insane.  I mean it was bumper to bumper past Rural.  Anyway, I ask the guy who I assume is the owner why the traffic was so bad.  At first he didn't know, but then realized that the 60 was closed.  He politely recommended that we head south then cut across to get back to the 10.  \n\nI ordered the Jerusalem Falafel sandwich. It was pretty good.  Though, in all honesty, falafel is not one those kind of dishes that one can gush over.  In my opinion, it's pretty hard to mess up deep frying ground chickpeas.  I ought to point out that the ingredients were very fresh.  This also applied to the side salad that comes with the combo meal.  My two friends opted for the gyros, and it looked good.  The meat was thinly sliced, which is somewhat different than others I've had.  They seemed to enjoy the meal, but I don't think they were quite overwhelmed by it either.  In fact, we didn't mention anything about the food during the hour and a half trip back home.  \n\nThe food is by no means bad at Pita Shack.  It's adequate to serviceable in terms of Mediterranean food.  The positives regarding the food have to be its freshness and price.  In fact, I spent no more than $8 for a sandwich, salad, and drink.  The service, as noted previously, is undoubtedly the most shining spot of the place.   As we were finishing up our meal, the guy who I assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house.  We declined after being quite filled and satisfied from our respective sandwiches.  I believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him, and he had positive comments about it.  Now, for me it's was the food that really matters.  Accordingly, I gave three stars, as opposed to the four that I was close to giving.  Should I ever return to the Tempe area hankering for food in a pita, I would most definitely give Pita Shack another shot; if only to support a genuinely nice guy's business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zonV2F6YNVn2_sI5dK82eg"}

A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since. \n\nI silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat.

Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced.

Ok I'll cut this short.\n\nThis Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more \"quaint\" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance \"browsing\"; this makes my girlfriend very angry.\n\nI don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it. \n\nOne last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty.

They only have them on Fridays though, and they often run out before dinner, so get there early if you want one!\n\nThey also have amazing seasonal flavors: salty caramel, dark chocolate raspberry, eggnog spice, chocolate peppermint, and the best: brown sugar praline! That one is an Easter flavor and I love the crunch of the praline combined with the brown sugar! YUM!\n\nYes, it is a bit pricey, but if you like the \"Sprinkles Cupcakes\" and \"Sprinkles Cupcakes Scottsdale\" Facebook pages they each do a daily whisper word that will get the first 50 people a free cupcake! I always try to buy another cupcake when I use them, so it's about $2 a cupcake then. Many times the whisper word will get you an off-the-menu cupcake, either a seasonal offering from a different part of the year or a cupcake creation. I had a lemon cake with strawberry frosting once, and it tasted like strawberry lemonade...delicious!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AqbgC7Gul5Es1rRzGNLDFA"}

Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60, and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable.  She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday, which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses.

Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary.

We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Denny's or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us 'kids' and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe that's just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is what's important. Also, the portions are huge and I wish they had more options for half meals because I don't like to waste food, but I know people like the giant portion thing.... I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1F-pelV0fTduYV_vCrvjLA"}

I had seen this resort from Scottsdale road many times and always thought I would like to stay there sometime. Now I am so glad I finally got the chance. We stayed for 2 nights over memorial day weekend. Upon check in I was asked if I would like to up grade to a king suite for $20 more a night. I said sounds good to me. I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort. Some of the other reviews said that this resort didn't have a resort feel. In my experience nothing could be further from the truth. I was treated better here than I have been at many 5 star resorts that I have stayed at in the past. Our suite was part of a 4 plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed. The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return  especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dJvUc4ViWEJ0NJfQtYo7xg"}

Here you'll find great people who love what they do and have an extensive amount of knowledge and experience. Oh, and I also recommend taking one of Faith's workshops... I took one recently and I learned some very valuable tools that will definitely help me in future auditions :D", "type": "review", "business_id": "qFPJ_bHbS13PoEEKNexnBQ"}

We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LzpR_jE6VIutJ08s2cdRrw"}

Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.\n\nAnyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.\n\nThis place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.\n\nI know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QnAzW6KMSciUcuJ20oI3Bw"}

But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS! \n\nPizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.\n\n Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.\n\nThere is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. \n\nThe employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box. \n\nI love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money.

We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  \n\nThey have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.\n\nWe had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  \n\nWe had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.\n\nLastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.\n\nOverall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.

I must admit the decor is far better than the typical nail joint; I too don't understand the point of pictures of really long red nails holding $100 bills...super cheesy.  This place does not disappoint with decor; it is like visiting a spa as opposed to a nail salon.  Also, I live nearby so this location is really terrific for me.  Unfortunately, I have been twice now...really, really wanted to make it work...and it just doesn't.  The first time, I paid extra for all kinds of services like a hot stone massage for my feet and extra callous remover,etc.  I left spending $90. No big deal if the product is good.  However, I had to go home and clean up the polish left gooped around my cuticles, file the hard edges of my nails down to something that wouldn't injure my husband, and the massage was like being tickled and then rubbed with a rock....basically no massage at all.  Today, I just tried the manicure to see if a different person would be better.  The standard massage was better, however, the gel polish application was no good...again gooped around my cuticles, and each nail of mine is filed into a different shape.  I now have to redo the whole thing myself.  Perhaps it is because I have not requested a particular nail person?  Possibly...the reviews I am reading that are 5 star seem to reference a particular person.  Maybe I will try one more time and request Kevin who seems to get good reviews.  If so, I will post again...hopefully with a better rating next time.  Right now this place is truly not worth more than two stars and those stars are only for good location, reasonable prices, and nice atmosphere.

The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.\n\nFirst off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.\n\nIn addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef \"medium\" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.\n\nFor dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream. \n\nThe environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you aren't splitting entrees....", "type": "review", "business_id": "k6Si433-EJrY4J7SZxsnjA"}

Orgasm\n\nWifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.\n\nI went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.  \n\nWe went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe. What a great meal, fargin amazing!!  Pics to come", "type": "review", "business_id": "iRg16D8dWjmv70NF68kgRA"}

The 7 layer dip was kinda dull, like they scooped out the filling of a microwaved bean and cheese burrito. Either way, all their food is pretty cheap, and during happy hour, drinks are a great deal. Also, I like the way the place is set up; most of it is outdoors/patio, so it makes for a different experience. There's also a lot of games and things to do. We saw a group of guys playing beer pong on one of the tables, and by the women's restroom there's a lobster catching game.

None of us had ever been there before so we were excited to see what this place was all about.\n\nSituated about a 10ish minute walk from the light rail station, it is a nice walk through a part of town where I wouldn't normally be.  You wouldn't think this place is a brewery because of its small size but it is.  The inside is very quaint and taverny.  It has a very relaxed vibe going on.\n\nI ordered the sampler and all their beers are pretty decent.  I decided on the Amber for my pint, but they were all good so it was a difficult decision.  Not bad for a little local brewery at all.  For a quick bite before we moved on we ordered the calamari and the bratwurst splitter.  The calamari was pretty standard and the aioli had a nice kick to it.  The bratwurst was excellent and unique.  Each was perfect to split among 4 people.  The rest of their menu looked good but is pretty much typical bar food.  Well probably a bit better than average bar food.  Anyway, it is perfect food for the place and looking back we should have probably eaten dinner there instead of only an appetizer.\n\nPro Tip:  Cross over to the north side of the street at the light as soon as you exit the light rail station.  Otherwise you will be dodging traffic as you try to cross because the place is located on the other side of the street far from another crosswalk.\n\nAnyway, I would like to come back for a few beers and food.

Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  \n\nFor food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  \n\nDefinitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.

However, now they do come with them and are still endless, but I did notice the burger prices went up to allow for the burgers to now come with fries...something that is always expected at any burger joint. They do have sweet potato fries that you can order, big plus. \n\nService has always been great, they are really quick with getting drink orders in and served to you. I've ordered a bunch of items from salads to fish tacos, and of course, their burgers. Everything has tasted decent and I'm not really sure what qualifies as having \"Fine Burgers\" in a restaurant title, but I don't think Islands has it. The restaurant itself is very clean and the bathrooms are well kept. The only downside is the acoustics in this place. It can get very loud when its busy and almost annoyingly loud when there are a few kids in the joint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hNVcBhJSD5HyLKMf_Z7TaA"}

That's the test of a good Italian restaurant for me.  If the sauce is good, they usually get thumbs up.  This sauce wasn't \"bad,\" but it was bland and watery.

Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing? \n\nThe Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy. \n\nWhat, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YKOvlBNkF4KpUP9q7x862w"}

I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals.  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is.\n\nThe place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd. \n\nTed also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try.

Manuels, Some Burro, Juans, Ajo Als, Macayos.  The two best are Ricardos and Papagayos, oops,  They closed because the new management wrecked the food and drove away the faithful.

We also played this course back in November when we were here in town and had an equally enjoyable time.\n\nThe course is in great shape and we were able to finish our round in around 4-5  hours.  The staff here are very friendly and accommodating and the beverage cart came by around 5 times during our round.  The price they gave us (as return out-of-towners) for a Sunday morning tee-time was incredible - 2 adults at $89 each + $40 rental + FREE junior fees + $15 junior rental.  Other similar quality local courses wanted to charge full fees for juniors for the same tee time, so I really appreciated the gesture. If they keep this policy in tact, this will be my regular course when my son and I come back in town.\n\nAs for the course, the early holes are typical resort style holes followed by 5 or so residential public course-style holes. The beauty of this course is the back-9 desert-style holes that wrap around into the south mountain before returning back into the resort with the final par-3 that provides a breath taking semi-panoramic view of the valley from downtown Phoenix to the Superstition Mountains.  I found the back-9 to be short, but very technical, constantly testing my course management abilities - i.e, thought I could hit onto the green (from the whites) on every par-4, but came up short every time.\n\nWould definitely recommend this course for other out-of-towners like me who want to get in a quick round on a nice course.  The pro shop is  small but well-stocked.  The restaurant has patio seating overlooking the first tee and serves some decent food.  However, they need to get better beers on tap (IPAs and microbrews would be nice!.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "vwOLtv-8syrddAstFmnwCg"}

Finally, a reasonably priced casual restaurant not owned by a corporation.  Or mad persons\n\nFirst of all, the waiter had no idea what the soup was or what kind of bread they had available since apparently their actual bread inventory bore no resemblance to the one printed on the menu. The waitress berated him for not knowing, and then went on to make it obvious she hadn't a clue herself. She tried to talk us into getting croissants. Neither of us were ordering things that belonged on croissants. My dining companion got a portabella burger that's a burger with a giant mushroom cap instead of meat for people sans veggie friends -and I got a chicken sandwich and Italian wedding soup. We had to repeat the order two or three times before the waiter got it.\n\nThe waiter subsequently returned my dining companion how she wanted her burger done. She gently pointed out that portabella burgers have only two possible states- done and note done. Such is the dichotomy of mushroom burger kind. \"Wait, you wanted a what?\" slurred the waiter. He had put in for a regular beef burger. Turned out, they didn't actually have a portabella in the place. \n\nWe waited. The soup showed up in one of those skinny coffee mugs and the waiter tried to pawn it off on the wrong person. It was pretty good soup, but there was simply no way to adjust the seasonings without making a sloshy mess. \n\nMy sandwich, well, it was OK. Nothing to write home about. I was very hungry and it didn't strike me until I was almost done the promised buttermilk ranch dressing was regular ranch with buttermilk.  My dining companion's fruit was on the old side, and her tuna melt not particularly tuna-tastic.\n\nWe are masochists. We decided to have some dessert. The one thing on the menu we wanted was, of course, not actually available, so we decided to just go with coffee. Mum ordered cold coffee. She specifically said, \"I'll have a small iced coffee.\" I ordered a double shot of espresso. Not too complex. \n\nThe waiter came back a moment to make sure I really wanted a double shot of espresso in my iced coffee.\n\nAbsolutely not worth the price or the obligatory trip to the twilight zone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c4FLMLP7hMnAbSiW2o_o3A"}

Seek it out:\n\nLet me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.\n\nP.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a \"gourmet\" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entr\u00e9es right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. \n\nOnce you've paid nearly $14 for their \"orange peel chicken\", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.\n\nEverything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.\n\nThings get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's \"i\" so that it would \"fit on the signs better,\" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great \"American Chinese\" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of \"wok charred beef\", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.\n\nThe decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:\n\n'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. \"Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,\" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. \"It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing.\" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'\n\nWhich is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xcOncADGPr9eki8OU5Ln7g"}

We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food. \n\nMichael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!. \n\nWe both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving. \n\nWe started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) ) \n\nAfter ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as \"cajun-style, but not overwhelming\". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce. \n\nThe result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert. \n\nExcellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.\n\nOne comment: The \"Branding\" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it \"Dominick's\" or \"Lincoln Avenue\", but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate.

There was a party going on behind screens, all Pakistanis, women & girls in traditional wear, balloons, lots of children that were literally running though the restaurant, squealing with delight. Very glad we were not expecting a romantic dinner... We approached it as cultural diversity, chose to enjoy the loud, festive atmosphere. OK... A little annoyed when one of the little girls did a few particularly high-pitched repeated squeals, & one kid bumped my chair as they chased each other across the restaurant...\n\nIt was less than an hour of closing, so we asked if the buffet was not such a good idea (been out a while, no fresh coming). The kid waiter went to ask, and we appreciate that he returned reporting that the menu would be a better choice to insure quality.\n\n Ordered lentil soup & sesame naan (new & listed on back pages). Lentil soup was soft yellow color, not darker lentils I'm used to. It was creamy with very small pieces of lentils. The flavor was more mild than I'm used to, but a subtle spicy. It was nice, no complaints. The sesame naan was fresh, crisp bottom, soft top layer, added a bit of salt and WOW delicious!! Lots of sesames on top, yum.\n\nThen ordered chicken tikka masala, as I'm working my husband into such foods, and he for sure likes this dish. Nice white breast meat which he prefers, simmered in that divine red creamy sauce. I'd call it mild heat at best. I'd prefer a bit spicier, but perfect for my husband. \n\nWe brought our beverage with us, after calling to make sure it was okay. Nothing is mentioned on the website one way or the other. They were very accommodating for this, brought us glasses, and offered an opener to use. I am under the impression there's a seating size limit to such places & not sure they don't exceed it, so I'm going to stay vague so they/we don't lose this option! It was GREAT - kept our bill nice and low.\n\nIf it wasn't for the Entertainment coupon, we wouldn't have known to try them... Now we will be back!\n\n4 stars not five because it was really good but not mind-blowing... It would take a big wow to have me give 5. Children thing doesn't affect score, as I know that was a celebration exception, and again chose to see it as a cultural experience. Omar works part-time, very nice, friendly, good customer service. He apologized for the chaotic environment, which was nice. \n\nSaw grumpy uncle at counter, no smile, but we didn't have any interaction with him. We were waited on mainly by a nice kid with puffy black hair, seemed a bit timid but did fine with everything. Omar came to us and chatted at the end of the evening.", "type": "review", "business_id": "15JZ0ME6eOtShdLctzfR6w"}

That is what I love about Great Clips. For the most part, I can stop in and be seen within 5 minutes like today and get a $13 haircut. You can't beat it. Most of the time, I just need the end of my layers cleaned up and why would I want to spend $60 on a haircut to do that?  I have never had any problems with not getting what I wanted. Sometimes, I'll also spend the extra $20-$25 and have them shampoo and blow-dry my hair straight. My hair always looks great when I do that, too. Today, I spent $38 on the cut, shampoo and blow-dry. The blow-dry took alot longer than I wanted today, but Keeyla (sp?) also took the flat-iron to it. Clearly the girl takes pride in her work and my hair looks really great for someone with very coarse, wavy hair. Every once in awhile you can get coupons for an $8 haircut in the mailers. They also give you a free haircut after 11 or 12. I haven't hit that milestone yet but I'll get there. The employees also seem really happy and the girl who did my hair today said alot of them have been there for at least 3 years.

Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  \n\nThe antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. \n\nThe stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasn't that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didn't order drinks.  \n\nYou do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials, but we didn't mind.

I hadn't eaten at a Sizzler since it was popular in '80s, so when we saw that they opened up again where Taco Tote used to be, we had to go and check it out!\n\nWhen we walked in, it was like reliving my childhood, when we went to Sizzler as a special dinner, to gorge on the salad buffet and the unlimited fried shrimp.  Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well!  The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli).  The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried.  They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad.\n\nThe salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from.  There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados.  I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired.  The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own.  The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result.  The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy.\n\nThe hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar.  There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from.  The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar.  There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), 2 meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce).  There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter.  The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings.  It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor.  \n\nService was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed.  One thing to note is that you cannot add tip to your receipt since you pay for your meal first, and then sit down, so cash will help for tipping your waiter!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TQNDCD50mkXwySB_qXmrXA"}

The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0K634ehk41ZRc4kj3NTAEQ"}

While it may not have been the ultimate dessert it was quite good and we enjoyed several bites before deciding we'd had enough to satisfy without adding unnecessarily to our growing waistlines.  Seeing we'd only eaten a bit, the waitress comped the dessert.  We explained we'd been happy with the mousse and were just full but she took it off the bill just the same.  \nNow, there are a lot of choices where to eat and a whole lot of pizza joints, but for my money a little extra courtesy goes a long way.  Couple that with good food and reasonable prices and La Bocca is sure to see more of me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YQvg0JCGRFUkb6reMMf3Iw"}

My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. \n\nThe decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  \n\nAs it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    \n\nMy final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say \"are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?\" or \"are we ready for dessert?\"  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, \"we\" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  \n\noh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.  \n\nTommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E28ht8IEiO6FZbKktSo0Xw"}

After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg"}

Their dining room is very small and sometimes there's a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything.\n\nThings I've tried there:\n\nLoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.\n\nTheir chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!\n\nTheir koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.  My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location, the food doesn't taste the same to me.  Maybe I'm just trippin' but that's how I feel.  \n\nOverall, this place is pretty awesome.  I can't wait for them to finish their expansion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K8pM6qQdYu5h6buRE1-_sw"}

It was like a bakery buffet, danielle is right there baking away behind a corner of the counter on most mornings.  I often go to Lola in the evenings (they close at 7 most nights, so sad) and by that time of day there are only a few cookies left, so obviously the regulars are tuned into the best time of day to get the baked goodies.  A guy in front of me on my 7 am visit scooped up half a warm coffeecake to deliver home to some lucky partner/roommate.  \n\nThe morning we visited, the 7-8 am hour was peaceful and calm, a great waking up time.

They did a pretty good job for being a sports bar, but not impressive. They claim their meat is fresh ground, though when that's the case, the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted.. okay, maybe they grind it in the AM and then stockpile patties for the day.. that's fine.  The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.  I did like that the meat was char-broiled and so it has a good taste to it.  Also, the inside wasn't over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant... tasty, actually.\n\nThe sides were blaaaah.. cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients (white cabbage, carrots, sugary mayo) something I would expect from Chili's or Denny's.\n\nWell, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring.

Currently I want free wi-fi most. Free wi-fi at Sky Harbor... Check. Secondly, convenient economy parking is a must. Convenient economy parking at Sky Harbor... Check. Not to mention the shuttle drivers are always friendly and small talk-ready.\n\nThe TSA folks here also seem to smile and playfully banter with travelers more readily than at other airports. Perhaps this is due in part to Sky Harbor's \"America's Friendliest Airport\" marketing ploy, but in any case it's certainly something to remark about.\n\nI doubt Phoenix will turn into any sort of true travel hub in the near future, but more non-stop international flights would certainly be welcomed. But until the demand is clearly defined we'll have to be content with a few flights to Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the lone wolf to Costa Rica.\n\nI am very excited to see the Sky Train completed and operational with Stage One scheduled to be up and running in 2013. This will allow connections from the light rail and offer a new mode of transportation from the east economy lot to terminal 4.\n\nI've seen previous reviews complaining about having to go back through security when changing terminals, which is actually the case in many airports throughout the world. The terminal is the secure area so whenever you leave it you naturally have to be screened again. There are a few exceptions, but the easiest way to circumvent this is to fly the same airline from point A all the way to point B. If you're connecting at Sky Harbor you should only be flying US Airways/United or Southwest so as to avoid a terminal change. If you're not flying these carriers then you're over-complicating things for yourself and you should look for different routing.\n\nThe central location of Sky Harbor makes it extremely accessible for people living in most parts of the valley, which is a huge plus considering the location of other airports outside of their corresponding metropolitan areas. All in all, there's really nothing significant to complain about Sky Harbor.\n\nP.S. The Fox Sports Grill at Sky Harbor is a true embarrassment, not that one should expect a great deal from airport restaurants, but if Kraft Mac-N-Cheese (this is probably a poor example as KMNC provides a perfect vehicle for some truly delicious creations) is far superior to what you're serving, then you should just end it all.

I walked by and someone sitting out front invited us in for a listen to their free music event. Once inside, the wife and I were greeted by the snack bar ladies asking us if we would like one of their cookies, candies or sodas in the bottle; we got a diet coke for a $1. \n\nThe Nash a decent sized venue with about 12 or so four seat tables to sit at, none of which are particularly better than another, with the tables in front being the only exception. The music was good, if you like Jazz music as I do, but I think the band playing this night put together an oddly slow paced set with more of a blues and 'experimental' Jazz than I would have liked to hear. From the amount of people walking out during their set, seemed like others also harbored the same opinion. I usually like my jazz with a little side of funk; a thick base line, Jazz guitar, and complimentary piano and horn of some type. We stuck around for about 5 songs and decided to move on. It was First Friday after all.\n\nThis place could really use some Kool, and maybe even the Gang. I imagine the music is subjective and changes on an event by event basis. I feel they really could step up the quality of foods, snacks, and drinks. The venue seemed more like it catered towards a teenaged crowd, especially considering their food choices were chips, candies, etc, and no adult beverages in sight. Although I can't see many teenagers running out to listen to a night of Jazz, I could be wrong though.\n\nIf I find that someone worth listening to is playing at The Nash, I will likely head out again; but I don't think I would plan on just dropping in randomly for an evening of Jazz.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix.

He was awesome, no complaints there.\n\nBar Smith though? They failed on so many levels. \n\nI got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. Not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. About 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. There was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. Why they put Z-Trip on the patio, I don't know. It's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 11 PM. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!! \n\nI was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down. \n\nAt that point I was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. They clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this DJ. They were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there. \n\nAfter finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. It was a total clusterfuck. I finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. Fantastic. No signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture. \n\nAlso, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee AT ALL during the 2+ hours you're there. If you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up. \n\nBy the time Z-Trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. I inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. Thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. At least people could move more easily downstairs. Plus the sound was better. And the bathrooms were actually accessible. \n\nEven at the end of the night, there were people standing in line waiting to get upstairs. Bar Smith gets a huge \"F\" as far as I'm concerned. I won't be back to this place for any headlining DJ. They obviously don't know how to run an event.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7_7fxuG9ESAFmx-AiMsJHg"}

You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you can't tell what's underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so you're good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas aren't great, but the beer is cold.

The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world. \n All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested. There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore. There were even some animated pieces. I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through. The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled. You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet. It is mind blowing. The whole world seems so much smaller, and it's brought together so beautifully. \n They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself. There is also a children's section to the museum. I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself. I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go. It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself.

It was definitely  not designed to be \"post-911\" friendly. Let me give you an example so that you will know what I mean: \n\nWe fly in from San Francisco and are told that we will have to go to another building via a bus. We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again... \n\nFlash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch. \n\nFinally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.) \n\nNext ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture! \n\nAnyway, we finally got to our gate and were able to grab a slice of pizza before boarding our plane (not before enduring the antics of a 70-year-old United Airlines power-hungry granny who couldn't seem to get her act together, but was determined to show everyone who was boss...)", "type": "review", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g"}

Two - you only have two people in your household so you don't really need a 20 lb bag of broccoli or a whole box of strawberries or tangerines.  Other than that it's a great place to stock up.  They have great deals on most frozen foods (try the all natural fish sticks).  Great deals on bottled water and cases of soda too.  If you buy a giant pack of Q-tips you won't run out for years!!  I love the \"Wipe and Clean\" individually wrapped cleaners for your glasses.  They come in a giant box of either 200 or 300 and last for at least six months.  They have good deals on books, DVDs, CDs, boxes and bags of snack foods like Doritos and Sun Chips, pretzels and microwave popcorn.  The bakery has some good stuff too.  I don't typically buy meat here because I do not have a large family nor do I have occasion to feed many people.  I hear the meat department is quite good though.  And Costco usually has the cheapest gas around too.  It's usually almost 10 cents cheaper then the closest gas station to me and I can stop by Costco on my way home from work.  Now if you're shopping and you require a snack, hit the snack bar.  Pizza by the slice, hot dogs, and these yummy things they call chicken bakes are pretty inexpensive.  So where else can you stock up, get cheap gas and get a snack for cheap?  Costco!  It's worth the membership and that membership gets you other perks too. They send coupons in the mail every month.

Also, make sure you chew fast because after a while the buns begin to go soggy - umm mushy bread with CK cover in buffalo sauce.... (Toast the CK it'll dry some of sauce and give a crispier texture)  Service was off too!  I had 1 beer and 2 waters -- that's all.  If you know me I like a few bottles and at least a jug of water with my meal :) - I know I can't get enough H2O!

Wanna know why? Read on.\n\nMy party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.\n\nOnce we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, \"So are you gonna do this or what?\" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.\n\nThe manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.\n\nThe food was good, but it's not always about the food.

I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.\n\nThere are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:\n\n1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).\n\n2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!  \n\n3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).\n\nJust try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place.

(Raised left eyebrow, and a smirk, but you already knew that)\n\nSo, initial impressions: Seemed like a confused ambience. Kind of clubish, with a little hubristic haze. The music was the only positive part, reminding me of HGTV's 'Selling New York.'\n\nThe waitstaff seemed somewhat confused, as we had 2 waiters at one point, but the bussers were top notch!\n\nWe were also sad to hear that the \"Happy hour\" menu was only in the bar.\n\nNow to the food: The menu and the prices associated gave me a bad feeling right quick. I am too used to excellent sushi, at fair prices, as well as happy hour menus with all the favorites. (Especially dragon rolls! YUMZOID!) \n\nWe proceeded to order a couple appetizers, and a handful of rolls. None of which were memorable in any positive light:\n\n The avocado roll was insipid with a strange clash of textures and flavors. (Soft avocado, and carrot sticks likeyourmompackedinyourbrownbaglunch and a strange dusting of what tasted like bread crumbs...) The spicy tuna had to be the only one that was acceptable, and it was interesting to have chunked tuna vs. the usual frappe. The softshell crab was weak, and the spicy yellow-tail was spicy, but pretty one-note, and not satisfying. \n\n ***Bottom line: We decided to pay our bill, and then go straight to one of our favorite sushi spots to satisfy the sushi craving that we definitely missed out on: HIRO sushi. Man, let me tell you, I threw down a D-backs roll and a Crazy roll, and Hiro sushi was indeed the sushi Hero of the day ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "bgTB6MgdVQssXhkNJ7qIfw"}

That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.\n\n   The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...\n\n   Eat here. It's really that simple. \n\n   Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front.

This amazing place makes all their ice creams and sorbets in house. Sweet Republic makes some pretty creative flavors. These are just a few examples of what we sampled:\n\nBasil Lime Sorbet\nSalted Butter Caramel\nApple Pie\nDessert Honey\nMaple Pecan\nAlmond Buttercrunch\nCashew Turtle\n\nAll of these flavors were wonderful but there was one more that really got me all hot and bothered, and that was their Honey Blue Cheese. That's right, Blue Cheese ice cream. When I first saw it, I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked. It tasted just like a sweet vanilla / honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it. I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal. It was sweet, tangy and somewhat salty, all at the same time. Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae. They have many toppings to choose from, including bacon brittle. When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce, bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch. This sundae was exploding with flavor. Every bite was crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy and delicious. \nMy fianc\u00e9 had a waffle cone sundae that contained Salted Butter Caramel ice cream, Almond Buttercrunch ice cream, salted caramel sauce, brownie bites and a homemade marshmallow. Hers was also amazing.\n\nThe service and prices here were both great. The girl working the night we visited allowed us to sample as many flavors as we wanted and was really friendly and patient with us. The prices here are similar to  Coldstone's. \n\nI'm absolutely in love with Sweet Republic and would seriously make a special trip to Scottsdale just to have their ice cream. I shouldn't be telling you all this, for fear that you all would think I'm a pig but I liked their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream so much that after I finished my sundae I ordered a Honey Blue Cheese milkshake to go.

Pita Jungle seems to break the mold. There's something for everyone on their menu, be it the Mediterranean Chicken Salad or the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza (both are awesome). \n\nPita Jungle is located off of Apache Blvd very close to the campus of Arizona State University. While this location is a favorite along the student body, a good mix of locals and students come here. The waitresses are very friendly and especially professional for a restaurant that serve so many college students. Like I mentioned above, many of the waitresses are super cute.\n\nHere is a meal of champions that I personally recommend\n\n1. Start off with the baba ganoush with chicken. This is not on the menu, but hummus with chicken is, so just as for this. You get a large portion of freshly made baba ganoush covered with chopped roasted chicken. This is DELICIOUS.\n\n2. For your main course, order the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. This is chicken breast with grilled tomatoes and onions with garlic sauce in a crispy pita wrap (lavosh). This comes with a Greek Salad, but they'll be happy to sub the salad for the garlic roasted potatoes for no charge.\n\n3. Finish your meal with the Baklava coupe. This comes with 3 types of ice cream (I remember it comes with pistachio ice cream!), and it comes with pieces of baklava. So delicious. Even if you feel full, once you see this, your stomach will magically make room.\n\nPita Jungle gets a solid 4 stars from me.

You see it here and there - the chimi sauce isn't quite the same, the beans are inconsistent, and the fundido just isn't as fun.  And to make matters worse, Valle Luna now demands superstar prices, asking for around $20 for a chimichanga dinner.  I hate to break this to you, guys, but I can get that - and done better - for much cheaper.  And don't even get me started on the rise of Rito's, Chipotle, and Juan's, all of which provide superior food for less than half the price.\n\nTheir prices have become ridiculous - and I think Valle Luna knows it, because this is one of the only restaurants I can think of that creates a version of their menu WITH NO PRICES for their website.  I'm serious: http://www.valleluna.com/VL_Menu3.html  It looks exactly like the regular menu, just without any idea of how crazy expensive their food has become.  I suppose they figure that you can't (or won't) leave after you've sat down, ordered drinks, and eaten some chips?\n\nBut much like that past-his-prime athlete, Valle Luna still has one move that reminds you of those glory days, like Jordan's fade-away jumper.  It was his best shot late in his career because it was the only shot he could cleanly get off.   Valle Luna's fried ice cream is so delicious, and since it's dessert, they can't charge $18 for it.   I wish I could tell you the exact price but that's censored on the online menu, too.   \n\nSo go for dessert sometime soon and reminisce about the glory days, because I suspect it won't be long before the game passes Valle Luna by and they're forced to hang up the aprons.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E3RjJH45EX6rHYDs0TYSRA"}

It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.\n\nThere were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.\n\nOccasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.\n\nThen something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.\n\nYes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  \n\nOf course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.

Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!

We were sat pretty promptly and had drink orders taken. I had the iced green tea and she had water which was garnished with a slice of cucumber. I thought that was a nice touch. \n\nWe both started with spring rolls - she had the salmon, I had the barbecue pork. Both looked good and mine was tasty. Then we had both had a bowl of chicken pho. It was really tasty, however expensive for pho at $10/bowl.\n\nThat said,  the food was good. Not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but yummy just the same. \n\nMy only gripes were the little things. I've worked in the back of the house for a long time. So I know how much it costs to put this food together.  I just felt like everything was expensive for what it was. This is not a high end restaurant. Its a teensy little hipsterish Vietnamese place with minimal decor. Its a lunch spot essentially. My menu was printed on paper which is pretty commonplace these days so no big whoop. Unfortunately the menu looked like it had been used about 50 times. I understand re-using menus. Its totally common. To NOT do so would be environmentally irresponsible. It just looked really, really used and abused. Also, my dipping sauce ramekin had a huge chip in it. To be fair, I am hyper critical of EVERYTHING when it comes to service just because I come from a restaurant background. \n\nRice Paper gets 3 stars from me. It was eh... Luckily I had good company.

Mill has plenty to offer for the ASU kids and the older adults, but for those of us who lie somewhere in between, places like La Bocca and Canteen are just right. \nCanteen one ups La Bocca, in fact, because there are menu items included in happy hour (50% off most drinks and select food items). Here are the highlights:\nThe margarita. It's a real margarita! (It's not a lime daiquiri masquerading as margarita. Loads of sour mix does not a margarita make.)\nThe chips and salsa. Both fresh and delicious. The pico de gallo is particularly fresh and delicious.\n The ribs. Sweet and spicy...the level of heat from the habenero is perfect and the meat literally falls right off the bones.\nThe ambiance. It's chic but not pretentious. My friends and I really enjoyed the Latin music. Our suggestion would be to emphasize that music and minimize the clubby stuff (it verges on Scottsdale).\nTo contextualize some of the other yelper's comments. I was glad to hear that one yelper didn't find Canteen suited to his beer and Jaeger shot needs. There's a bar (or ten) down the street for that. For the yelpers that found the portions to be too small, I suspect they didn't understand the Mexican take on tapas that the taco menu is going for (in fact, the whole valley suffers from a lack of tapas locations). Finally, the service complains...my service has been cordial and attentive, even when super-busy. Folks, this place is new, let's let it go through it's growing pains before issuing such harsh judgments that might jeopardize the success of a really wonderful place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9YUe5J_cPCBo_mL7-z9HCQ"}

We were told they would make things right and they were very apologetic for the horrible evening we had.  (We were so irritated with the place, we waited 4 months to take him up on the offer)\nAs an aside, we were told we would be comped dinner due to the previous disaster.\n\nI called ahead and spoke to Jason, who does not work at Bolero's any longer, but stated that since he was the manager at the time the incident occurred, he would make sure the new manager was aware that they needed to adhere to his promise to make things right.  Was told to call manager Desi, but no one answered.  Proceeded to the restaurant and hoped for the best.  \n\nWhen we got there, as before, we stood at the front desk for between 5 and 10 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  Not a promising start.  Luckily though, that's where the lame service ended.\n\nWe had Gage as a server and he did a terrific job.  He was attentive, stopped by to fill our drinks often, checked to make sure our food was good, brought things out all at the same time, and was pleasant to deal with.  \n\nWe started with the cheese plate and it was, as before, good although probably could use some more bread with it as there are a ton of meats and cheeses and 4 small pieces of bread.  As far as the food goes, she had the spinach salad, and I had the reuben with onion rings.  Both dishes were well prepared and tasty.  We asked for a basket of bread, which was brought out with dinner.  The bread was great, but they maybe ought to consider bringing it out early, maybe just asking people if they'd like bread with their meal.  Just a suggestion.\n\nOur only other concern as far as the menu goes is that there are not a lot of vegetarian offerings that aren't salad.  \n\nOverall, it was a much better experience.  As we said before, Gage did a great job, and even though Jason is no longer the manager there, Dave (who was standing in for Desi, from what we were told) took care of everything.  They put effort into making this experience much better and they did a good job.  We both appreciated it and we'd go back.\n\nThere it is, an updated review.  Bolero's is in a beautiful location and now we can say the service & food are worth a visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GavgziItjOIkqqf7zm5w3g"}

Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb!

Somehow, with all these people, they managed to completely ignore us for most of our meal.  Making a typical 45 minute to 1 hour dinner experience turn into a 2 hour ordeal.\n\nThe decor of this place is beautiful.  Cool, clean, and modern.  The music fluctuates from being too loud and inappropriate for the setting to being perfect with an eclectic but well blended mix. \n\nThe pizza is decent, but very appetizer-ish.  It is cracker thin, which turns a lot of people off, but I actually like it.  The onion strings are to die for when they aren't completely grease laden.  That's an off and on thing, not really consistent.  I don't like their sandwiches.  They are unimaginative and bland.  There really isn't a lot to choose from on the menu.\n\nUnfortunately both times we brought friends along with us, the place was a buzz kill, and I am not really sure why.  Maybe we will try the place again now that it has been open for a while.  Hopefully Hanny's has figured out what he wants to be when he grows up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

Stage is raised to a proper height, acoustics are pretty decent and the sound system is adequate for live acts. Three trapezoidal speakers flown above the stage provide good coverage and nice clarity. There's a couple of subs tucked beneath the stage. They have some moving lights(mirrors move not heads), and some LED par cans. Monitors are on the stage floor, and are JBLs so they seem decent. If it were up to me, I'd toss about 12 more cans on the front wash and add some side wash. They have the trussing to do it .\n\nStaff is attractive, and friendly. Knowledgeable about the area and eateries too. There's a patio where you can smoke outside, and they have heaters so you don't freeze your *** off. Drinks are reasonably priced for Scottsdale - and they had some good specials last night which ranged from beer to cinnamon whiskey to vodka - so your bases should be covered.\n\nI'd go back. Go early, or good luck parking. Also - note that last night was Christmas week, so even though it was Wednesday tons of cops were out and about, pulling over all kinds of people as they left Old Town Scottsdale.

Plus, you cannot beat a bottle of vino and 4 types of bruschetta for $20 every Monday and Tuesday after 8pm!\n\nI am also a huge fan of their Pretzel Pub Board and NYC Grilled Cheese that is companied by a Sierra Nevada Mustard, Pesto and Ketchup dipping sauces, washed down with a cold Stella Artois Lager Belgium.  These menu items have sparked inspiration for me to make similar dishes in my own kitchen more than a time or two.

It showed me that Zinburger really knows their burgers and takes the time to educate their staff. It also served to heighten my expectations...which weren't let down.\n\nThe quality of my burger was very apparent. The bun was fresh, the meat was high grade, and the other ingredients were also well thought out. I love when restaurants are meticulous with their creations. This is a superb burger, expertly prepared from the creation of the patty (not too compressed) to the cooking of it (a perfectly pink in the middle \"medium\" is what I ordered and received). Simply great.\n\nThe milkshakes are over-the-top rich and delicious--like eating whole pint of Haagen Dazs. We all shared one, and it was still overkill. Great tasting though.\n\nThe fries were a little \"meh\" to me. Not sure why. They were hot & fresh, but a little bland. I tried the Truffle Fries as well, and they were also a little boring. Maybe they should try a different kind of oil or potato...or both. They were decent fries, just not as \"top notch\" good as the burgers.\n\nLastly, for a \"burger joint,\" the service was excellent...to the point of fine dining type pampering. Very nice.

Read my most recent review on how that went (ie, a bust.)\n\nWe stopped at Starbucks at the Safeway next to Over Easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what we'd do.  I turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was Taylor's Cafe open, they do breakfast, and they were only about a mile from where we were.  We decided to give breakfast one more try, called Taylor's and put our names on the list.\n\nWhen we arrived it was a little hard to find, but we called and they told us where it is.  The decor is cozy and inviting.  We waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied, the manager was very attentive.  I told him what happened at Over Easy and he was horrified.  We live in Avondale, we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service.  Let me tell you, Taylor's Cafe really turned the morning around for us!\n\nMy kids each ordered an apple juice, and one got chocolate chip pancakes, the other got strawberry waffles.  Their kids menu is $8 each, but the portions are huge, it's easily something an adult would put away.  I stole a bite from each, they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags.\n\nMy husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage.  With his omelet he got 2 choices for sides, so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese (he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese.)  The chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected.  He also ordered a mocha, which at $4 was about the size of what you'd get at Starbucks, and my husband said that it was on par with their quality.\n\nI ordered the Joe's special, intrigued by the list of ingredients.  It was flavorful and delicious.  The country potatoes were very tasty.  I ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade, it was tangy and sweet, really tasty on a hot summer day.\n\nWe came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good, but not out of this world.  They have fantastic options for the health conscious, and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear.  There is plenty of space (you don't feel like sardines in a can), the staff is polite, competent, and professional,  and the ambiance is nice.

Phoenix Mountain Animal gave me a very reasonable price on the initial exam and the actual removal, stitches, etc... ended up being much more affordable than any place I had called. I was originally offered care credit( a payment plan) but I ended up not needing it because the bill was within reason. I just picked up my dog and he was a little sleepy from the local anesthetic, so we will see how the next few days go.

I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.\n\nI decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals. \n\nI try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me.

Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.  It was quaint.  It was old school.  It kinda made me a little nervous!\n\nThe general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.  Our water glass was NEVER refilled.  Got a little more nervous.\n\nThey brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.\n\nI ordered the Chicken al Berto.  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!  Nom nom nom.  The balsamic was excellent as well.  I must now do peppers with my Caprese!\n\nThen our entrees came out.  My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.  I'm super happy it was!  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.  Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!! OMG!!  Freaking amazing!  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!  Divine.  \n\nIt took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's \"chill\" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.  I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.  The portion of entrees were HUGE.  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.\n\nIt's on my new list of first priority restaurants.  And I think the prices were pretty good.  Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.

The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again.

I used to go to a really good Salvadorian restaurant in Seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where I live now. So the BF and I got here at around 8 at night on a Sunday and it was actually pretty busy. This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and I would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. So I ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the BF ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. Well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which I liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. All of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. The red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. Also, about 5 minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said 'oh I forgot to tell you we don't have any tamales.' Well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? Also, it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend (since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which I guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasn't good. So we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. We got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. So this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which I thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). Anyway, the empanadas were ok, but I've had better. The sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isn't all that sweet. Oh well, I would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time, the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty....", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxPPpj5jJKO8DtapF5S-NQ"}

The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!!\n\n2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.\n\nThe only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.\n\nOh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago.

My good friend and I were eager to see the type of energy that the new investors have injected into a local legend, the Wigwam in Litchfield Park. \n\nAs time was flying by, in the last 10 years, the AZ Kitchen (also in the Wigwam Resort) closed for dinner.  This southwestern gem was also affectionately called the 'Snake Pit' by a friend but the service was top notch and it was one of the earlier restaurants that provided full view of the kitchen by diners.  The Wigwam's ballroom dining has now been converted to Red's Steakhouse. \n\nService started out well with a nice touch of a choice of fruit for your water.  The waiter had recommendations but also allowed us time to ponder the menu.  We opted for the couple's dinner, essentially a prix fixe with a salad, choice of sea bass or steak, and the shared dessert.  We also decided to try the crab cake appetizer - just to adventure through the menu a bit; this resulted in a stern warning from the waiter that the steaks were 14 ounces. \n\nThe crab cake was a nice presentation with fresh crab and a toasted crunchy top and colorful spinach bottom.   The side avocado dressing was a bit heavy for the crab and appeared similar to the faux guacamole at cheaper eateries.  However the crab was dry and the waiter brought more of this dressing out for us. \n\nThe service with the Caesar salad presentation began to falter. The salad is the craze of serving entire stalks of the romaine and a toasted slice of bread.  Reminding the waiter for salt and pepper, he promptly provided a set and advised us the salt was also in a grinder. My friend determined that the pepper grinder was broken and did not provide a coarse grind and the waiter asked if we would like another pepper grinder.  Actually, for the prix fixe price of $45, I really wanted the waiter to politely grind the salt and pepper over our salads.  The crouton had no flavor. \n\nOur steaks were done as ordered but the NY Strip did not have a lot of flavor. The menu indicates the meat is grilled at 1600 degrees. However, my medium rare steak really appeared to be grilled on my a standard grill with no caramelizing or searing to hold in the rare juices. The steaks were true to size of waiter's tip. \n\nThe steaks were served with two asparagus stalks which appeared to be white asparagus with green tips, a unique veggie for the plate. \nAn au gratin potato patty also accompanied the steak and was quite yummy. \n\nAs the server boxed up our plates, they brought out a raspberry mouse.  Its flavor did not impress either of us but my girlfriend did find the mascarpone center and it was addictive. \n\nService was not astute nor attentive and sometimes baffling.  We were just into the meal when the waiter dramatically closed the drapes of the window near us. One of the other diner's called out in sadness to lose the evening sun but the waiter shushed her and said they would be opened intermittently to avoid blinding other diners. Could Red's should consider awnings or subtle window shades to preserve our dining views? \n\nThe Wigwam may not be hoppin' just yet; but  as we left the restaurant, the three restaurants on Old Litchfield Road - outside the gates of the resort - were busy as locals may have enjoyed more reasonable fare and better service.  These restaurants are our next adventure!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZLVX6bQt8HJH5d4pq5EJGQ"}

I happened to be in the area, popping in to buy a backpack at Staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when I got back to my office.\n\nOne thing I really didn't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom.  That's something very typical of, like, a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor.  I went to the bathroom and it said I had to ask for the key.  I went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so I kinda just did a little pee-pee dance until she came back.\n\nIt was a little too expensive for what it was.  A thing of chips was like $4.50.  That's crazy.  Granted, the chips are really good and you get a lot of em, but... don't you have a thing of chips I can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion?  I got all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday, probably.\n\nThe burrito I got was very tasty.  The salsa they gave me was also super good.  Nice and smokey and spicy.

They are amazing at their jobs. I finally found out that Victoria's Secret is that their bras suck! \n\nSo I bought a bra online to pick up at the store, but when I went in and tried it on, it didn't fit. I thought that sizes for that brand ran a little differently. I told the sales girl, and she asked me if I minded if she measured me. I said sure and she followed me into the dressing room. \n\nWhen we got in there she told me to take off my top! I'll be honest here, I thought she was going to measure me over my shirt, and I almost peed a little. I decided to pretend like it was no big deal to take my top off in front of a total stranger, and just took it off. Not sure if she noticed my slight hesitation, but she probably did, oh well. I generally like to go on a couple of dates before I take my top off if you know what I am saying.\n\nWell guess what? That is the best way to get a good measurement it turns out! The salesgirl told me to wait a few moments and she would be back with some bras. She came back with two of the most wonderful, comfortable, and supportive bras I have ever owned! So instead of getting one bra that day, I got two.\n\nI have to say, my hat (or my top) is off to Nordstrom for training their staff to be great at their jobs, and for having fabulous bras. \n\nLadies, please don't bother buying another bra at Victoria's Secret!

The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean.

The problem with my first visit was two-fold: 1) The beers that were most interesting to me had run dry; 2) The food I ordered was pretty hard to grunt down. And although I sat at the bar with my compadre and tried to make conversation with the bartender about the different beers offered, it was fairly one-sided. I did not get a dose of craft beer expertise from what is arguably a brewpub that showcases a true love for beer.\n\nSo regardless of the less-than-stellar first visit, I still was impressed with the selection of draft beer especially the regional offerings. The built-in beer coolers are also a testament to a great place to sample different labels. The one thing I must caution others against is the food. The steak sandwich I ordered (with special gardiniera) was pretty lousy. The beef had a precooked-then frozen-then reheated quality. The gardiniera was essentially all jalape\u00f1os and too fiery to eat... I had to scrape a fair amount of them off to make it edible. I had a good time drinking some decent beers with my friend, but we both regretted our food choice.\n\nMy return visit restored my faith. The beer list was current and updated. There was a large variety of new draft beers to choose from, and my group ordered two pizzas. This place has delicious pizza! Our waiter was especially knowledgeable about the beers being offered and was able to help us choose especially interesting ones. I like the atmosphere and crowd at Papago and intend to return. But I will definitely stick to the pizza.", "type": "review", "business_id": "luCSjoNQ9q_0QIjKKOy2pQ"}

I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi W\u00fcrze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kr\u00e4uter salat kr\u00f6nung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can't find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy).\n\nI stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberkn\u00f6del (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fzHlul2mHy_jwJc-WBRvlg"}

We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I can't remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste. \n\nMusketeer #1 had the Shrimp Po' Boy sammy and was overwhelmingly awesome! With its fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping, this po boy claimed to have died several times. The fries were good, I'm sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal. \n\nand me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! That's the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely.\n\nMusketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their \"famous\" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didn't need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly weren't about to send it back! The three of us died over that one! \n\nTo my yelpers I say: if you have the cash to spend (three of us cost a lil over a hundred clams), a few hours spend on dinner (we were there a while) and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana in order to keep from jumping off a cliff into the chain resturant valley... then this is the spot for you!

What's more, he treats his job like it was his own business; e.g., at the end of the meal he gave us a business card and added he would enjoy serving us the next time.  And there will be a next time and a next time and a next time.  \n\nSemi-quick facts, anyone?  (It's rare a Texan has a short story.).  \n\n-- Good, warm bread; accompanying olive oil was herbaceous and handily decanted from a table-set bottle\n-- Da Beau ordered a starter of (peeled!) asparagus with tomatoes and gorgonzola that was lightly dressed with a tangy vinaigrette.  The leftover tomatoes and 'zola were a treat atop the warm, oil-dipped bread\n-- We both ordered -- and consumed to the point of making a happy plate -- the barrumunda atop lentils and sauteed spinach.  This was our first tasting of barrumunda.  A moderately white fish, it is native to the rivers of Australia and reminded me of good ol' Texas catfish.  (Note to self:  fry-up a batch of panko-crusted barrumunda at home.).  The three fillets of fish, lentils and spinach were perfectly seasoned (read:  a smidgen of salt).  \n\nAgain, pay no attention to the reviews, here, about bad service.

Great food and a desire to serve!  Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten, egg, dairy, and soy-free and tasted great!  And he threw in a few organic surprises.  Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food.  On our second trip, Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel (in the shape of a sausage, of course) and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap.  She chose the wrap (more fun) and loved it.  I have NEVER had personalized service like this!  Cool place, cool patio, great beer selection, great-tasting unique food selections, and, best of all, great people!

But I much prefer the flavor of Smashburger's meat. Five Guys seemed rather devoid of meaningful seasoning, or if it was there, it was killed in the well-doneing. \n\nI also didn't really like that it comes out as two carelessly charred mini-patties, instead of one, nicely cooked and seasoned burger.\n\nAs far as Mill-area burgers are concerned, I'm at the following:\n1.Smashburger  2. Chuckbox 3.  In N Out 4. Five Guys 5. Fatburger\n\nAnd Chuckbox and Smashburger are awfully close. I've been a HUGE fan of Chuckbox for forever, so many I like the newness of Smashburger, but damn is it tasty. I also prefer the Smashfries to Chuckbox's fries, but I think I prefer 5 Guys' fries to both of them.\n\nFinally, the price is obnoxious. You're not getting that much in the way of a burger for $11 (drink + fries + cheeseburger). You get a MOUNTAIN of fries, but I don't NEED that many fries. You also get to top it with just about anything, but I don't want to subsidize other people's toppings. Let me pay $2 less to get mine with lettuce, ketchup, and mayo.\n\nOverall a meh burger. Not great, but better than Fatburger, if I don't want to walk to College for great burgerness.\n\nOh, as for atmosphere, it was like a club in there. I really don't need to be bombarded with music at lunch when I'm going to talk to someone.

The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.\n4) Cool decor both interior and exterior. \n\nBad:\n1) Bed pillows were too squishy. \n2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.\n3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.\n\nUgly:\n1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really \"ugly\".\n\nOverall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6Kon3cR5ZEm5rmYKlpcfcw"}

I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it.\n\nIt looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.\n\nThe stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.\n\nThe decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.\n\nA surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair.\n\nI very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day, with all the factors stacked against them, but I won't be returning to find out if this was the case.", "type": "review", "business_id": "irVjrnurmB03bTaj9BXofg"}

This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.\n\nCochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a \"torta\" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.\n \nThe other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).\n\nThe Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.\n\nThe Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.\n\nAs I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).\n\nThe pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.\n\nThe burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.\n\nI used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.\n\nFor example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. \n\nAnother example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).\n\nThe best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.\n\nOverall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.\n\nFYI. Chandler is the only one with a drive-thru.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dBMd0f09nJCHURtmGHQPIQ"}

I think it just opened yesterday or today, but it's just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months.\nIt's hard to explain the texture of the ice. It's thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet it's not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like it's just not as good as Rita's. I guess that's why it's Italian ice. It's in its own category!\n\nThere are 3 main types: Gelati's (custard-ice-custard), Blendini's (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. There's also a sugar substitute version of their ice and today's sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing!\nThe menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change. \nBefore, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt. Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet! Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "liXaSXrIXjikvdSEI2inxA"}

It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot.  I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go.  Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there.  I brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch. Yes, I also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well.  It was a dark meat chicken, white meat can be substituted, in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews. However it was done well. No one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasn't a ton of sauce. The egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well. I like the fact that they will deliver as far south as Camelback, north to Cactus, east to 60th street, and west to 96th. They are open until 9:30 pm seven days a week which is nice as well. I went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and I have to say that while the soup was good, the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that I have had in Arizona. They don't have that \"just unfrozen\" taste that many restaurants have. I think I would have given them that fifth star had they had both scallion pancakes and noodles w/ sesame sauce on their menu, but alas they do not.  I look forward to going back and trying many of their other dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oOehX_l0odQc-tu81VUkIg"}

We got the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I don't eat pig so I can't comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.\n\nService:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.

What killed it for me? The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle.\n\nFirst when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue. \n\nUsually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue.\n\nSo why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this. \n\nHonestly, if my fiance and I were the only individuals funding our wedding, then we probably would have considered this place (more than likely, VEGAS).

They weren't busy. \n\nWe sat out on the patio and watched all the folks across the walkway start to congregate outside Pizzeria Bianco in the rain. It was an unbelievable an hour and a half prior to opening, they have at least two seatings of Guests waiting in the rain - I swear there's got to be something addictive in that crust. I love Bianco, I do, but I am also (sometimes) very logical. Show up at 5 p.m., go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown, or Bar Bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner - don't stand in the rain for an hour and a half!\n\nBut, I digress...we're discussing the Rose and the Crown. Okay. Cute, compartmentalized rooms, yes. Homey feel, yes. Good selection of beer, yes. Good wine, no. Well made cocktails, yes. Menu, eh, okay. Service, eh, poor to okay.  Patio seats, rocking good!

From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries.\nWalking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect.\nOur server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!\nAfter Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better?\nWell apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.\nThis review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.

What's there now? An empty dirt lot. The Co-Op was driven out by an over zealous real estate company that, in the boom of condo building, bought the location, driving Co-Op to another spot where it eventually failed. Know what else failed? That condo endeavor. Now, a few years later, we have this budding marketplace with a lot to live up to.\nMy first trip in, I didn't have anything particular I needed, I just wanted to check things out (though I was making enchiladas later that day, so had a few items I was on the look-out for). \nIt's pretty small right now, and in the former building of Jake's Shop, which is also another Tempe staple now gone. But it had the basics such as milk, peanut butter, a small selection of produce -- local, of course -- cheese and even some gift-type items for sale in the back. \nI picked up some green onions (99 cents for a bunch) and red peppers ($1.29/ea), and thought those prices were exact with a chain grocery. And bread - this is my favorite part of the store! A big selection of sliced wheats and grains, and rolls and longer Ciabatta styles too. And the favorite of my favorite? Fresh \"Made this morning!\" tortillas! They looked delicious, and were HUGE. The size of a large pizza, they came in flavored varieties for making yummy wraps.\nWhen I checked out ($5 minimum for credit card purchases, and a sign said \"EBT coming soon\"), I was offered another red pepper from a basket by the register because this small batch was about to go bad. So instead of letting them and then throwing them away, they *give* them away with each purchase - wonderful! \nOh, and I was surprised and pleased to see a small corner of the store set up with a couple small tables and a couch, all within view of a large flat screen playing Alice in Wonderland. Sure enough, a kid sat there, out of the way and quiet, while is parents shopped. Both parents and the childless thank the owners for THAT kid haven, I'm sure.\nI really look forward to coming in again and again and watching this place grow and thrive.\n\np.s.

There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account. This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)! Yum!\n\nThere are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.  The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables). The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it, and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now...but it's still good ;)\n\nNot only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to. Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home. The best thing about Karey's Kitchen is having a Filipino restaurant in Phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the East or West Valley!", "type": "review", "business_id": "sZAzeccYUVPjlkrlMooV-g"}

I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.\n\nI ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one! \n\nOur service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.\n\nI will definitely wait a while for a return visit.

Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. \n\nThey normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.\n\nThey also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.\n\nThey are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4WcxnNv_lzCIG2eb8O5Mlg"}

You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. \n\nOn my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.\n\nThe sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. \"Hey, fire!\" I thought. It was a nice touch.\n\nThen I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.\n\nReal, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. \n\nThe sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h6jfMpTZpNduLG0wE2tbaw"}

Honestly, there is no comparison! \n\nWith that being said, this is the BEST Trader Joe's I have been too! (and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US) The sheer size of this store, in TJ standards, is IMPRESSIVE!  The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people (with carts) to maneuver through.  And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable!  \n\nSome of my fav's are: \n\n$3.99 Trader Joe's Coastal Cab...FABULOUS for the price! (Quite honestly though, I haven't EVER had a bad wine at Traders...they have an amazing selection that isn't overwhelming but isn't sparse either.) I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines and/or regions so they are quick and easy to find! \n\nThe Haircot Verts (French Green Beans) are simply delicious! Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity; just enough for two people at two different meals.  They even have Nulaid \"Ready Egg\" (i.e. egg beaters) for $3.69! At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that!! \n\nTheir cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable! Their artesian breads are so yummy...although not a \"low fat/fat free\" food, so that is a once every few months splurge. (and even then we only get the small loaf (which I want to say is called a \"little bastard.\" That name CRACKS me up!) \n\nAnd although I am not a \"sweet\" eater, my hubs is...so he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here. The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joe's with Peppermint Crumble (or something like that.) I'd go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a two-three day period is acceptable! \n\nIt also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags; as any good eco-friendly shopper would do! There is a weekly drawing for a TJ's gift card (I think the value is $25) and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags. (not one for each bag...just one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in) Then they draw a name out of all the tickets (which you drop in a box on your way out of the store) once a week.  \n\nIf you shop more than once a week, you can \"earn\" a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning. (although I am PRETTY sure the majority of Surprise/Sun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds aren't THAT great! )\n\nRegardless, this is just a great little \"market\" through and through. I used to get excited to shop at TJ's...now I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there! (and it's not just to try and win the gift card either..that's an added bonus!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "OzrOuMIig4Zvq1qyFutH2Q"}

His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.\n\nDaniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.\n\nWhen we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).\n\nWhen Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.\n\nThe menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page.\n\nSome might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.\n\nUnfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.\n\nDaniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy.\n\nP.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IpqgfODLFPww-6TxCk-LJQ"}

These types of places just don't seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive.\n\nAllow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.\n\nSecond, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.\n\nThird, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff \"who wrote such and such?\". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  \"who wrote such and such\". If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up. It's this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.\n\nThe only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GwSdGrvaXi4BdXNSWKn-EA"}

This place reminds me of a narrow cave that happens to have a long bar with about 18 stools, six larger booths that can fit five patrons comfortably, four table tops, and three double occupancy booths. The bar is pretty cool, its lined with red lights and has eight rather large flat screen TVs you can see from the stools and the larger booths that we were seated at. I opted for the Sweet and Spicy burger ($12), thanks to Yelp, and my mom went with a plain ole cheeseburger ($11). Knowing that the burgers do not come with anything, we decided to order the sweet potato fries ($5) and both got iced teas ($2.5 each). My burger was delicious and was everything the title said it would be...sweet and spicy thanks to the sweet glazed jalapenos. I also enjoyed the crunchy, deep fried ratatouille, yum. My mom wasn't impressed with her simple cheeseburger and said she would order mine if she were to come back and we both enjoyed sharing the sweet potato fries.\n\nBrent, our server, did a great job with suggestions and service.

With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and even Safeway around here, I wouldn't go to Whole Foods regularly, for ANYTHING, unless I was a bajillionaire. 1. It's wayyyy overpriced. I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price! \n\nWe got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example. The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.\n\nMy 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she \"didn't have a register person\" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out. \n\nThey get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles). This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry. We went to Trader Joe's after, got twice as much stuff, and spent half as much money.

Unfortunately two ladies got there 1 sec before us and got the last table, the waiting area was packed with a group just hangin' and they had a 16 ppl reservation for later. There had sitting available right away at the bar but I'm pregnant and my back is killing me so bar stools were out of the question. They were very apologetic, which I thought was nice considering if wasn't their fault. I'm glad they're doing well. So I asked my husband if he wanted to try District and off we went. Actually, I made a reservation in case something happened and well, we ended up there.\n\nNice and spacious, not crowded at all.  They were part of AZ restaurant week and we ordered from that menu.\n\nShrimp sliders- I loved them! They should have a big version of it!\nDuck quesadilla- Very good as well, but I'm partial to anything with goat cheese.\n\nWe both got the country chicken steak and it was really good. Mine came 1 med, 1 small pieces instead of a big one. The med piece was a bit dry and the breading was slightly burnt. The smaller one was perfect, juicy and crispy. The breading flavor was really good, slightly  spicy. The biscuits were awesome!! More of a cake-bread texture, light and fluffy and kind of sweet. Green beans were tasty as well.\n\nStrawberry shortcake whoopie pies with lime basil sorbet ( I think it was a sorbet)- It was good, but not something I'll order again. The pie filling was too sweet, even the tartness of the sorbet couldn't help it.\n\nService was prompt, no hovering or having to wait for too long and our food came at a perfect pace.\n\nGreat dining experience and it made me forget about Tuck Shop. I still want to try it though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9ziO3NpoNTKHvIKCBFB_fQ"}

First of all, I had made a reservation for 7:30 more that a week in advanced and we waited until 7:50 to be seated. This was a bad omen, because, as it turns out, the whole night was made up of waiting. Our waiter (who did not share his name, unfortunately because I would tell anyone to avoid him at all costs) was terrible. TERRIBLE. He came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. Each time was a weird excuse. First time he came by I asked for a restaurant week menu, he said 'a restroom menu?' Why would I say that, then I ordered a glass of moscato and he's like the XXXX (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the ONLY moscato.... I was like ya... WTF? So I screamed what I wanted and he's like oh.... sorry.... I can't hear. Then he said 'Oh hey, I'll be back to explain things.' Explain what? we're clearly ready! 'Oh hey, are you ready to order? Well let me go take the order of that big table back there and I'll be back to take yours' (real quote) WHAT? Seriously? We waited over 40 minutes to order. What's worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! What, were we not wearing the right clothes? Were we not hip enough to be served? Or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? Come on.\n\n So he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. We got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. This was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. We ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). We got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). The soup was really weird, not bad, just different. The salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but I don't like salmon, so I didn't try it. Then the waiter came by and said 'oh we're really busy tonight, that's why it's taking a long time for the food) Notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. He also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird. \n\nWe waited and waited and finally out food came. I ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. I thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. The meatloaf was fantastic! It was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. Supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, I didn't try it. We ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful. \n\nSo then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says 'oh, cuz I think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but I'll look' Well two people had ordered the pot de creme TWO HOURS AGO!!!! Why weren't they left aside? 'Oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected' Well, We had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. It does not make sense. What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu. It turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, i'll have the peach crisp then....'oh, well we're out of that too cuz like it's made fresh from peaches and we didn't buy enough for all of the extra people....' \n\nMaybe if we had been served in a TIMELY manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldn't have run out. Oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. The desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what I want in a tiramisu, but fine, I guess. \n\nFinally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didn't spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, The waiter comes by, and the BF starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. The snarky jerk waiter says 'Oh, you mean follow the directions, ok.' So much attitude! So rude. I wish we left no tip, cuz that's what was deserved.

That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  So essentially they are asking me to pay $15 instead of $5 for a drink I may or may not want (then again, I'm traveling with a child so who am I kidding, I'm going to need a drink).  And to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because Beckham doesn't have a picture ID.  I tell them but he does have a picture ID.  He has a passport, in fact he has two.  The Southwest person tells me no one has two passports so I tell him that no, it's true.  The toddler and I both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (Not that we would need them to fly to California so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  The Southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.

It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8\") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12\")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too!

The food wasn't good back then but it was open 24/7 and always available.\n\nSince the change in ownership, I have been repeatedly disappointed.  The size of the menu has gone down drastically (which is understandable, Long Wong's menu was way too big).  They only serve slices of pizza at certain times of the day now (noonish until 3pm supposedly I think? and again some time in the evening) and you never know if they will actually have slices.  I understand that maybe they don't sell that many slices in the off hours, but I would gladly take a slice of pizza that was an hour or two old over none at all.  Not to mention even at 3pm it is not uncommon to get a pretty old slice anyways.\n\nThe burgers are so-so.  Better than McDonald's, but just really not that good.\n\nI've only had the cheesesteak once, and boy was it a disaster.  I bit into it and what must have been a full cup of liquid poured out of it.  I'm not sure how this was possible, but it was almost like it was sabotaged.  I'm sure this was a one-off problem and that they are not normally like that, but I was horrified and have not tried another.\n\nThe owner is eager and you can tell he is really trying to make the business work.  However, the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes.  I've heard some snotty tones of voice saying they had no slices when I've tried to order a slice of pizza during the off hours and have been refused a simple refill of my soda when my order took far longer than expected.  That said, I have not been there in a few months so this may have changed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lPAHpSIc2MvY06bWxrFRiw"}

We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, men's etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful. Most of our visit was in ladies dresses. Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macy's stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size. Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking. We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful.

My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo. The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours). We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area. The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.\n\nThe bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of. I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour. Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour).

Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.\n\nI am a beer lover. I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world. You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews.

As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, I've had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it.\n\nOk, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.  \n\nI take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didn't have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathan's pickles.  Nathan's, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didn't even know Nathan's made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest.\n\nAnyways, I go up to the counter where there doesn't seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompie's? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.  \n\nHere is the breakdown of the food we ordered-\n\nMatzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldn't go all the way to Chompie's for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen. \n\nPlain bagel \"toasted\" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn't even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! \n\nCorned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn't very good, it wasn't corned enough.  If they make their own they didn't use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn't handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.\n\nKnish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I'm also Irish....I've never met a potato dish I didn't like.  Until today.  I didn't even finish my half of the knish. \n\nNow for the prices.  What's with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I've paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn't happening.  \n\nWhy anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I don't know!", "type": "review", "business_id": "KV-yJLmlODfUG1Mkds6kYw"}

I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed.

I asked for a manager.\n \nThe manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.\n \nUpon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned.

Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles....\n\nAll that said, we will probably go next year because we still do not know the definition of insanity.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TCi5dyUUVHvFctgkstc1Kg"}

The facilities are clean and very well maintained.  Housekeeping staff is fantastic also.  They were not intrusive and they were hospitable.  \n\nHowever, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff.  I was mistreated.  I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was \"Are you a guest here?\"  Followed by \"because we get a lot of people around here...\"  While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk.  This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no.  I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look.  I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool?  Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land.  Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital.  So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers.  Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool.  \n\nThen on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk.  There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc.  I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no.  It had been misplaced.  Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener.  Strange how they had one for him, but not for me. \n\nRegardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me.  I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against.  It's a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card.  \n\nThe rooms are large here.  The elevator takes forever!  I suggest that the hotel adopt elevator music to distract the sluggish speed of that elevator.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u3_amLppmBrfBYUfaI0nVw"}

It's a step up from a used furniture store. It's two steps up from a thrift store or a pawn shop. It's three steps up from a garage sale. The prices reflect all of this, but it's still pretty reasonable. \n\nSellers - as long as you didn't buy the ugliest couch in the world and you didn't let your dogs hump on it, then it'll probably sell here. They will look at your furniture first before allowing you to bring it in so you aren't wasting anyone's time. You can even bring in a picture and a pillow if that's easier. In fact, you can even email a photo to them that they will go by. \n\nIf it sells, they will give you anywhere from 45 to 55 percent of the money collected. To find out if it has sold, you can call. For security reasons, they won't give out much information over the phone, so you must bring in your paperwork to even ask how much it sold for. This is pretty annoying and inconvenient - they should do email notifications at least - but you can go into any location to get this information at least.\n\nI got the impression that they will let you set your own price, but typically they will price your items for you. Good. Compared to what you would probably get for them if you sold them yourself on your driveway, you're going to be happy (even when you realize you're only getting half the amount they set). They will also sometimes come pick up your items if you need help. \n\nBuyers - the store is laid out pretty well and they seem to only take quality items that would sell, so you won't find a bunch of ugly donated junk. Some of the items are out of date, but still in good shape. You're probably not going to find some grossly under priced antique that you could flip at an auction, but if you need to fill up a room in your house - it's a good place to shop. \n\nWeekends seem to be busy for them, so I imagine their stock changes constantly. You're going to be paying higher prices than you would at garage sales or thrift stores, but the prices here are flexible and you're definitely saving money over buying new.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dLBqf9QayF9eSUzz6BvmSQ"}

It is sooooo good.\n\nWe went here on Saturday night with a group of friends, and we had a great time.

I felt like our waitress did a good job, and I was actually shocked at how quickly some of the food came (I am sure they are popular dishes that the kitchen makes in high volume, but still - she did a good job of getting them to our table). \n\nI started with a caesar salad, which I didn't think was that great. It was fine, but it wasn't as good as I expected. I then enjoyed the fish tacos for dinner, which were really tasty. The dish was plentiful, and it was more than enough food. My husband ordered the fried chicken, which was absolutely divine. The chicken was so moist and tender, and the chicken was fried without being greasy. Yummmm.\n\nI tried the red velvet cake for dessert, and it was quite good. How can anything with cheesecake frosting be wrong?\n\nThis is a great casual upscale restaurant. I was disappointed that I hadn't been sooner. The atmosphere is great, and the location is good. Plus, there's plenty of parking (and valet), so it's just convenient. I sort of feel like that's what this restaurant is - a convenient staple when you want a solid meal. The prices are slightly high for what it is ($18 for fish tacos and rice?), but I am desensitized to the high restaurant prices here unfortunately.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3oZcTGb_oDHGwZFiP-7kxQ"}

My wife didn't necessarily find it great, but ate some and didn't complain :-).  I think the Doner Kabob was the best.

It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas. \n\nFinally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.

When I reflect on the idea of buffets -- Sweet Tomatoes excluded, since lots of salad means lots of Good-For-You-ness, right?... --  I feel like I used up my lifetime maximum instances of buffet-eating in college, where the dining halls were all-you-can eat.  Anyway, this place just opened and is within walking distance of where I live, so my neighbors and I decided to check it out.  \n\nOverall I wasn't very impressed with the food, even in comparison to other Chinese food buffets I've been to in the past.  In addition to a standard selection of Chinese buffet items (beef with broccoli, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken) they have sushi, pizza (for kids, I'm assuming), and a hibachi grill section where you can pick vegetables and meats and they'll stir fry it for you (included in the buffet price).  The hibachi stir fry I made up was OK, but the sauce added to it was too salty for me.  The sushi was bland and what you would expect from a grocery store.  They only had regular high-sodium soy sauce, as far as I could tell.  (I tried asking one of the wait staff for low-sodium soy sauce and there was a language barrier; he brought back another staff member to our table, who also didn't understand what I was asking.)  The egg roll I tried was really salty (even without sauce) and nothing to write home about.  Usually sweet & sour sauce can make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating, but the S&S sauce on the buffet was a downright-scary Kool-Aid-red color.  However, the fresh pineapple and melon was a nice touch, as were the 8 different ice cream flavors on the far end of the line.\n\nI will say it was pretty cheap at $10 per adult, so if you're looking for a lot of food on a budget, it might be a decent option for you.  Personally though, I just think I am past the days of eating foods with scary salt levels, artificial colors, etc., so I won't plan on going back (though if I had to return for some reason, there are enough edible options so that I wouldn't starve).", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckZVnb6gF3PPVWkoVhAiEw"}
